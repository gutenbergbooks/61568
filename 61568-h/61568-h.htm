<h2 class='nobreak'>Editor’s Introduction</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>When They Were Girls</span> contains the stories
of a group of American women, each
one of whom occupies a very important place
in her particular field. The stories of these
women have been written many times before.
We feel, however, that in this book you possibly
may find that their stories have been
written in a little different way. Our desire
has been to bring very closely to the attention
of our many readers some of the outstanding
characteristics in the girlhoods of
these women, and to show the relationship
between these qualities in girlhood and the
achievements of adult life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To many people, doubtless to almost everyone,
comes the desire to produce results, to
achieve, and to add one’s bit to the welfare
of the world. Sometimes one is apt to become
impatient, and to feel that he is not arriving
at his goal. Under such circumstances
it is helpful for us to acquaint ourselves
with the life story of someone whom
we feel has reached the goal for which we are
striving. We may then learn that success
does not come overnight, but that years of
careful, painstaking work are often spent before
the contribution that one has for the
world is completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is so easy to admire someone who has attained
success, and to wish for that same
success and recognition oneself. Often, however,
we are not willing to pay the price that
he or she paid. To very few people does success
come easily. The small minority to
whom it does seem to come in that way can
only remain successful through careful,
painstaking work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women whose stories are within this
book have not obtained the praise of the
world easily. As girls, some of them were
wealthy, some of them were very poor; but
they <span class='it'>all</span> had obstacles to overcome. Each
one had her own way to make. No amount
of money, nor an especially fine environment,
could ever be the means of making anyone
successful. Success comes not from without,
but from within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, of course, desirable to have every opportunity
that will help to develop one’s particular
ability. The greater a person’s opportunity
to receive help from all available
good sources, the better it is for him. However,
success depends upon oneself. No
amount of encouragement, no effort put
forth by loving parents, no amount of money
expended for advantageous purposes, will
ever accomplish great things unless the person
himself really desires to achieve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No matter how small our part in the world
may seem, it is possible for us each to do our
work in such a way that it will prove to be a
forerunner of greater things to come. We
can take but one step at a time, and by taking
that step as best we know how we shall be
led to something higher. In reading the
stories in this book you will see at once that
when these women were girls they had no
idea of what they would ultimately achieve.
Nevertheless, they each took the steps that
seemed necessary to their progress, as each
step presented itself. This careful preparation,
this conscientious work, has enabled
these women to give to the world their best,
and has made it possible for us to profit not
only by their gifts but by their example, as
well.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Jane Addams—</h2>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Became a Neighbor To the Needy</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do people live in such horrid little houses
so close together, Father?” asked seven-year-old
Jane on a trip to the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At home in the village, when she was tired
of playing in the big roomy house, she could
run across the green to the stream by her
father’s mill. Here, in the city, instead of
wide green slopes and the low hum of the
sawmill were narrow, dirty alleys and the
clatter of carts and street cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Addams explained that some
people do not have money enough to choose
pleasant places for their homes, Jane declared:
“When I grow up, I shall have a large
house, of course, but I shall not have it
among other fine houses, but right in the
midst of horrid little houses like these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, strangely enough, when she grew up,
she did that very thing. She went to live in
a big house situated in the midst of poor Chicago
tenements. Later, this little girl, who
was Jane Addams, became known all over
the world as the friend of the poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane Addams was born at Cedarville, Illinois,
September 6, 1860. Little Jane could
not remember her mother, who died when
she was a baby, but she thought that no little
girl ever had a father like hers. She was
proud of his imposing figure, and she loved
him dearly. Though he was a very busy
man he always had time to answer her questions.
She had a great many to ask, too, for
even as a small child she did a good deal of
thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane’s father had been a state senator for
sixteen years and could tell her interesting
stories about the history of the country. He
talked to her so often about Abraham Lincoln,
who had been his friend, that Jane felt
almost as if she herself had known the great-hearted
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Sunday Jane appeared before her
father dressed for Sunday school in a beautiful
new coat. It was a finer coat than any
other little girl in the village had. For this
reason, Mr. Addams suggested that Jane
wear her old coat to save the feelings of the
other little girls. Jane consented to do so,
although she was very much disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they walked to Sunday school, Jane
wondered how the good things of life could
be more evenly divided. Ever since she had
first seen the “horrid little houses” about a
year before, her young mind had been busy
with this problem. Jane turned to her father
and asked him how it could be solved. He
explained that even though everything cannot
be divided evenly, people should act and
dress in such a way that those who are less
fortunate will not be made to feel so. He
told her that in school and church, at least,
people should be able to feel that they belong
to one family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane Addams attended the village school,
and later, at seventeen years of age, entered
Rockford Seminary, at Rockford, Illinois.
Soon after she was graduated from this
school it was declared a college, and she received
the degree of B. A.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had intended after her graduation to
study medicine and to help the poor, but she
was urged to go abroad because she was in
poor health. While in London and elsewhere,
she was greatly distressed by the
wretched condition of the poor. Now she
was more determined than ever to go about
the work of helping others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Addams believed that it is better to
show people how to help themselves than to
give them gifts of money. “It is hard to help
people one does not know,” she reasoned,
“and how can one really know people without
seeing them very often?” True to the
decision she had made as a child, she resolved
to live among the poor and be a real neighbor
to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the help of some friends, Miss
Addams opened Hull-House, which is located
in a tenement section of Chicago. Here,
she established a day nursery where mothers
who had to go out to work could leave their
babies in good care. A kindergarten was organized
for the young children in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are clubs for girls and boys, and
also for men and women. Classes in sewing,
cooking, and millinery are conducted for the
girls. “The Young Heroes,” a boy’s club, to-day
has for its own use a five-story building
equipped with recreation and study rooms.
Printing, photography, and many other
trades can be learned there. Hull-House,
originally occupying one building, is now using
thirteen buildings, each fitted for some
special service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For more than thirty years Miss Addams
and her fellow-workers have stood ready to
do any neighborly act, from bathing little
babies to teaching and entertaining lonely
old women. At Hull-House a cordial welcome
always awaits everyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides her friendly aid to those who flock
to Hull-House, Jane Addams has been a good
neighbor to people whom she has never seen.
She helped to have a law passed in Illinois to
prevent children who are under fourteen
years of age from working in factories.
Through her efforts public baths have been
provided in Chicago. Remembering the
merry games she played as a child on the
river banks near her home, she has made
many a plea for more playgrounds for city
girls and boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Addams has been a member, often
the chairman, of many important committees
that have been organized to plan ways for
making the world a better place in which to
live. She has also found time to write books
on this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane Addams might have given money to
the poor and spent her time in travel and
amusement, but she preferred to give herself.
Because she loves people enough to
learn what they really need and works <span class='it'>with</span>
them as well as <span class='it'>for</span> them, thousands bless her
as a true friend and neighbor.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Louisa M. Alcott—</h2>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Whose Stories of Real Life Are A Delight to Girls and Boys</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Louisa Alcott peeped into her
journal on the morning of her tenth
birthday, she found a little note
from her mother filled with loving messages.
It read: “I give you the pencil-case I promised,
for I have observed that you are fond of
writing, and wish to encourage the habit.”
Louisa’s mother often wrote little messages
in her daughter’s journal, urging her
to keep on trying to be good. Very often the
notes encouraged Louisa to go on writing.
On both her fourteenth and fifteenth birthdays
her mother’s gift was a pen, with a
poem and a loving letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Louisa, at eight years of age, had written
a little verse about a robin, Mrs. Alcott
hoped that her daughter would some day be
a great writer. It was a hope that was realized,
for Louisa M. Alcott’s books have become
famous, delighting each succeeding
generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Little Women</span>, her first great success, is
the story of the Alcott family. It tells of
their jolly times and their hard times at the
Orchard House at Concord, Massachusetts.
The lively outspoken “Jo” of the story, writing
in the attic, is Louisa herself; the other
“March” girls are her own dear sisters,
Anna, Elizabeth, and Abba May. “Marmee,”
of course, is the beloved mother, and
Mr. March, the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisa May Alcott was born at Germantown,
Pennsylvania, November 29, 1832, but
most of her girlhood was spent in Boston
and Concord, Massachusetts. It was a happy
life that she led even though the food was
plain and her clothes were generally “made
over.” There was never enough money to go
around in the Alcott family, but there was
no lack of love, kindness, good conversation,
and good reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisa and her sisters received their education
chiefly from their father, a man of
rare intellect. Mr. Alcott was devoted to his
children and he took great pleasure in teaching
them. In addition to these daily lessons
there often were long, hard tasks of sewing
and ironing, but there was plenty of time for
play, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What fun they had! In the old barn at
Concord with their playmates, the children
of Ralph Waldo Emerson and of Nathaniel
Hawthorne, they acted out their favorite
fairy tales and also <span class='it'>The Pilgrim’s Progress</span>.
Their giant tumbled off the loft when Jack
cut down the bean stalk, and there was a real
pumpkin for Cinderella’s coach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their mother’s birthday was always a
great event. When that day arrived Louisa
would say to herself as soon as she awoke,
“It’s Mother’s birthday: I must be very
good.” After breakfast the children always
gave their mother her presents. One year
Louisa’s gift was a cross made of moss with
a bit of poetry attached. That day there
were no lessons, and everybody was very
jolly and happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two great joys of Louisa’s life were books
and the outdoors. She enjoyed a quiet corner
with a good book. She also loved to run
in the woods in the early morning before the
dew was off the grass. She liked to feel the
velvety moss under her feet and to look up
into the green branches overhead. Once,
when she was a child, she paused in her
running and stood still listening to the rustle
of the pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seemed as if I <span class='it'>felt</span> God,” she wrote in
her journal, “and I prayed in my heart that
I might keep that happy sense of nearness
all my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisa had a quick temper and found difficulty
in managing it. At fourteen years of
age she wrote a poem about her struggles entitled,
“My Little Kingdom.” It began:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“A little kingdom I possess,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Where thoughts and feelings dwell.</p>
<p class='line0'>And very hard I find the task</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of governing it well;</p>
<p class='line0'>For passion tempts and troubles me,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A wayward will misleads,</p>
<p class='line0'>And selfishness its shadow casts</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On all my words and deeds.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>She kept on trying, however, and never let
her little kingdom control her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Louisa Alcott grew older she began to
realize very keenly all the cares that burdened
the dear “Marmee” because of their lack
of money. None of Mr. Alcott’s ventures in
teaching or lecturing had added much to the
family treasury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisa was determined to help and she
willingly did any kind of work that would enable
her to earn a little money for her dear
ones. Sometimes she taught school, sometimes
she helped a relative with the housework,
and sometimes she took care of an invalid
child. Often she did fine needlework.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While her hands were busy with her daily
tasks, her brain was active planning stories.
She wrote them late at night, and soon publishers
began to accept them and pay her
small sums of money. For her first story,
written when she was sixteen years old, she
was paid five dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Writing was a joy to Louisa Alcott and
sewing a tiresome task. However, she continued
her sewing because at first the needle
paid better than the pen. It was a pleasure
to her to earn enough money to buy a new
shawl for “Marmee,” a crimson ribbon for
May’s bonnet, or a new carpet for the whole
family. Cheerfully she wore her old bonnet
and her shabby shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During her spare moments, the young author
continued to write happily in her attic.
To her delight the mail often brought her the
news that her stories had been accepted.
This greatly encouraged her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the Civil War. Louisa realized
that no matter how greatly she desired to
write, her first duty was to her country.
Therefore, she went to the Union Hotel Hospital
at Georgetown, D. C., as a nurse. The
letters that she wrote home telling of her
experiences were later published as a book
called <span class='it'>Hospital Sketches</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Miss Alcott’s work had become
so well known that she was asked to
write a book for girls. She began to write
<span class='it'>Little Women</span> to prove to the publisher
that she could not write for girls. What she
did prove everybody knows. Young people
and their elders as well, not only in this country
but also abroad, were soon laughing and
crying over the doings of the “March” girls.
Miss Alcott had become famous.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Little Men</span> and other books followed rapidly
and proved so popular that Miss Alcott
received many thousands of dollars
from her writings. She was happy because
now she could fulfill her dream of giving her
dear mother some of the comforts that she
had never had. It was but small return, she
felt, for all the help and encouragement that
her mother had given her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Alcott’s books have lived because they
show people as they really are. They tell,
too, how jolly and happy life can be if people
think less about money and more about living
unselfishly and enjoying the outdoors
and the simple and beautiful things of life.
Louisa M. Alcott could not help writing in
this way, for it was the way in which she herself
lived.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Susan B. Anthony—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Who Worked for Sixty Years to Secure Rights for Women</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Susan vigorously attacked,
with her broom, the cobweb in the
corner of the schoolroom ceiling. It
was a stubborn cobweb and Susan had to
step upon the teacher’s desk to reach it. No
girl trained by so good a housekeeper as
Susan’s mother could be happy in the same
room with a cobweb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deborah will be pleased to have the room
clean,” thought Susan. However, Deborah,
her Quaker teacher, was not pleased.
Susan’s heavy shoes had broken the desk
hinges, and the girl who had tried to do well
was severely scolded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was often very much like this in Susan
B. Anthony’s later life. When she tried her
hardest to brush away the cobwebs that kept
the world from seeing that women did not
have the same rights as men, she was jeered
and scorned. Nevertheless, she kept on
wielding her broom, the broom she used being
her clever tongue. This little Quaker
girl grew up to be an interesting and eloquent
lecturer, who never lost an opportunity
to speak a good word for her fellow-women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan Brownell Anthony was born February
15, 1820, in Adams, Massachusetts,
in the midst of the Berkshire Hills. She
was the second of eight children. Every
night, as a little girl, she used to watch the
sun go down behind “Old Greylock.” She
came to love the great mountain, and all her
life she liked to think of its rugged strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Anthony was a very busy woman. In
addition to caring for her lively little children
she also cooked and washed for a number
of factory hands. However, she found
time to read good books and to be interested
in all her children’s doings. Susan’s father
was a Quaker, a man much liked and respected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an early age little Susan learned to be
a good cook and housekeeper, like her mother.
Once, when Mrs. Anthony was ill, twelve-year-old
Susan with the help of her two sisters,
ten and fourteen years of age, did all
the household tasks, including packing the
lunch boxes for the factory hands. Susan
was so anxious that everything should be
done exactly right that she and her sisters
carried samples of the food to their mother
for her approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three years of age Susan, who was very
bright and quick, learned her letters and also
some words, while on a visit at her grandmother’s.
When she was a little older she
attended a district school, and then a private
school conducted in the Anthony home.
Later, she joined her sister at a boarding
school near Philadelphia, where she studied
for a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan began to teach in a district school
when she was seventeen years old. She was
boarded in turn at the homes of her pupils,
being paid in addition only one dollar and a
half a week. Susan was a very successful
teacher, and often she grew indignant to see
that men who did not do their work so well
as she received four times as much pay.
Equal pay for equal work was one of the
rights that she began to demand for her fellow-women
from that time on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Susan’s father failed in business,
she saw his creditors take all of her mother’s
personal things. Susan was enraged with
the injustice of it and declared that there
should be a law to make a wife’s belongings
her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1851 Miss Anthony made a trip to
Seneca Falls, New York, to urge the admission
of girls to the People’s College then
being founded. There she met Miss Lucy
Stone and had an opportunity to become well
acquainted with her and also with Mrs. Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, whom she had met a few
months before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stanton and Miss Stone believed that
women should have a share in making the
laws of the land, and Miss Anthony soon became
their most ardent co-worker. Twenty-five
years later, Miss Anthony drafted the
federal suffrage amendment. However, it
was forty-five years from the time that the
amendment was drafted until it became a
part of our Constitution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan B. Anthony was one of the greatest
friends that women have ever had. When
she was born there were only three things
that a girl who wanted to earn her living
could do: be a millhand, a servant, or a
teacher. Before the close of Miss Anthony’s
life, a girl might fit herself to be a doctor, a
lawyer, a business woman, or, in fact, almost
anything that she chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Miss Anthony was a young girl, the
doors of nearly all colleges were closed to
women. The girl who dared to ask for as
much education as was given to her brother
was considered a great oddity. However,
Miss Anthony lived to see girls admitted to
college quite as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan B. Anthony found a world where a
married woman could not do what she liked
with the property that she owned. Neither
could she do as she wished with the money
that she had earned or received as a gift.
She could not even take charge of her own
children if anyone objected. Miss Anthony
left a world where women’s rights in all these
matters were considered and where in four
states women could help to make the laws.
The Nineteenth Amendment, giving women
the vote, came later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Anthony devoted all of her time to
public speaking. She traveled from coast to
coast, always making the most of every opportunity
to speak in behalf of the various
reforms to which she devoted over sixty
years of her life. Sometimes she pleaded for
the freedom of the slaves, sometimes for
temperance, but <span class='it'>always</span> for her favorite
cause—rights for women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan B. Anthony kept on pleading for
women, no matter how much people laughed
at her. Gradually, the world began to see
some reason in what she said. To-day, all
women who cast their vote, control their
property, and send their daughters to college,
can thank the determined Quaker girl
who had such a large share in giving women
their rights.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Clara Barton—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Unfurled The First American Red Cross Flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barton family was made very
happy on the Christmas of 1821 with
the gift of a baby girl. The four older
sisters and brothers gave the baby a royal
welcome, though they little thought that this
gift was also to be a Christmas present to
the whole world. This baby was Clara Barton,
called in Civil War times the “Angel of
the Battlefield” and known by all nations as
the founder of the American Red Cross
Society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby Clara grew up to be the pet of the
family, although no coddling was allowed on
the Barton farm in Oxford, Massachusetts.
Each member of the family wanted to teach
her something, and Clara was equally eager
to learn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Barton taught her daughter to be
level headed. Nothing could have been
worth more to the girl who was to be the
first woman to carry organized aid to the
wounded on an American battlefield. Mrs.
Barton also taught Clara to sew, to cook, and
to be an excellent housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara was particularly grateful for this
knowledge and had countless opportunities
to use it. Once a dying soldier whispered his
wish for a custard pie, crinkly around the
edge, to remind him of home. With what
materials she could get together, Miss Barton
made the pie and scalloped the edge with
her finger, just as her mother had taught
her to do in the farm kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Big Brother David who taught the
little sister many things that were to make
her a very practical “Angel of the Battlefield.”
At five years of age, thanks to his
training, she rode wild horses like a young
Mexican. This skill in managing any horse
meant the saving of countless lives when she
had to gallop all night in a trooper’s saddle
to reach the wounded men. David taught
her, also, to drive a nail straight, to tie a
knot that would hold, and to think and act
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From her father Clara heard thrilling
tales of his fighting in the Revolutionary
War under “Mad Anthony” Wayne. These
stories doubtless made a deep impression on
the youthful listener. Little did she realize
that in the years to come she, too, would play
an important part on many battlefields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara Barton attended a boarding school
for a short time. However, she received her
education chiefly at home, being taught by
her brother and then by a tutor. Later she
had an opportunity for more advanced study
at a near-by school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little farm girl was busy and happy
from morning until night, for she loved to
do things. She went for the cows, helped
with the milking and churning, and had a
hand in planting the potatoes. When the
house was being painted, she begged to help
with that, too, and she learned how to mix
the paint as well as to put it on. Once she
went into her brother’s factory and learned
how to weave cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her first experience as a nurse came at the
age of eleven when Big Brother David was
injured by a fall. For two years this cheerful,
patient little nurse scarcely left his bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was only fifteen years old, Clara
Barton began to teach school. She taught
well, too, for she understood girls and boys.
It seemed as if she had found the work that
she best liked to do. However, after eighteen
years of teaching, her health necessitated
her giving up this profession. Clara Barton
did not know how to be idle, so she went
to Washington and secured a position in the
Patent Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Civil War broke out many
wounded soldiers were brought to Washington.
Clara Barton helped to care for these
boys, some of whom were her former pupils
from Massachusetts. She also sent out appeals
for money and supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Miss Barton saw the wounded taken
from the transports, she was extremely
sorry for them because they did not have
proper care. She felt that she must go to
nurse the soldiers who were close to the battlefields.
This was entirely against army
regulations, but Miss Barton was very persistent.
She was finally allowed to take her
store of bandages and other supplies to the
front, where they were most needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People used to ask Miss Barton if she had
not always been brave. The woman who
walked coolly through Fredericksburg when
every street was a firing line answered, telling
of her childhood: “I was a shrinking little
bundle of fears—fears of thunder, fears
of strange faces, fears of my strange self.”
It was when the shy girl forgot herself in
working for others that she forgot her fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bravery and willingness to help others,
however, would have been of little use to
Clara Barton had she not been level headed.
The ability to see what should be done next
and to do it quickly and well were of equal
value. It seemed as if Clara Barton worked
magic, but her magic was only a mixture of
common sense and a great pity for the suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once at Antietam, when there seemed to
be nothing to feed to the wounded men, she
noticed that the medicine had been packed
in fine meal. Quickly she borrowed several
big kettles from the farm where they were
quartered, and she soon was serving the men
with steaming gruel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At another time, at nightfall, one of the
doctors complained about the mismanagement
that left him with a thousand wounded
men to care for and only an inch of candle
for a light. Miss Barton had fortunately
brought along several boxes of lanterns,
which she gave him. Her remarkable
forethought meant the saving of many a life
that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the Civil War Clara Barton did not
give up her work of mercy. For four years
she helped to trace missing soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While in Europe, during the Franco-Prussian
War, she saw the wonderful work
that the Red Cross societies abroad were doing.
She was deeply impressed with the
value of such an organization and immediately
decided that, upon her return to the
United States, she would do all that she could
to interest her country in the Red Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Barton worked for years to persuade
the United States to found an American Red
Cross Society. “We shall never have another
war,” people objected. However, Miss
Barton pointed out that in time of great
floods, fires, earthquakes, and other disasters
lives could be saved by organized aid. At
last she was successful, for in 1882 the American
Red Cross Society came into being.
Clara Barton was its president for many
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red Cross banner was first unfurled
for service in this country at Miss Barton’s
home at Dansville, New York, where she established
a local chapter to aid the forest-fire
sufferers in Michigan. Ever since that
time the Red Cross has continued to give its
efficient aid wherever needed. It had an exceptional
opportunity during the World War
to prove its worth. Our country has cause
for deep gratitude to Clara Barton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara Barton risked her life on sixteen
battlefields of the Civil War to care for the
wounded. She founded the organization
that has brought relief to thousands of people
in war and disaster. She did great deeds,
but they were possible only because she had
learned to do the little things of life well.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Amy Marcy Cheney Beach—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Made Melodies</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, the conquering hero comes”
rang out in the studio, clear and
true as a bell. The photographer
thrust his head out from under the big black
hood of the camera and stared in amazement
at the tiny sitter. The two-year-old child
was singing the very air that he had been
practicing for the first peace jubilee, and she
was singing it absolutely correctly. Others
were eventually to be astonished at the musical
ability of this little girl, who grew up to
be America’s foremost woman composer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy Marcy Cheney was born in the little
town of Henniker, New Hampshire, September
5, 1867. From the time that she was a
year old, her talent amazed even her musical
mother. She learned dozens of airs and sang
them, keeping the pitch perfectly. She
would listen delightedly for hours to violin
music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the age of four Amy was finally allowed
to play on the piano. Often when her
aunt was seated at the instrument, little Amy
would stand on a hassock and play with her,
making up an accompaniment as she went
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as other little girls plan how to arrange
their playhouses or how to make new
dresses for their dolls, this little girl used to
think out tunes. Once, when she was visiting
at a house where there was no piano, she
composed a little piece of music. She remembered
it and three months later was
able to play it correctly on the piano at home.
She had composed three other little pieces
before she was seven years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before Amy knew the names of musical
notes, she knew their meaning and could
read them. It amused her to transpose from
one key to another, and she never found it
difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was six years old Amy thought
that she should have regular music lessons,
so she begged her mother, who was an excellent
pianist, to teach her. You may be sure
that little Amy Cheney never had to be urged
to practice. At seven years of age she played
several times in public. Before long she
was playing difficult music from Chopin,
Bach, and other composers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Amy was eight years old her family
moved to Boston. The prominent musicians
of this city before whom she played agreed
that she was ready to go to Europe to study
music. However, Mr. and Mrs. Cheney did
not want their little girl to be trained only
in music. They knew that she would be happier
and healthier if she were to go to school
with children of her own age. They also
realized that she should have plenty of time
to romp and play outdoors with other
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy was therefore sent to a private
school, conducted by Mr. W. L. Whittemore,
where she rapidly mastered the regular
studies. She was greatly helped in her piano
work by her good ear and accurate memory.
She was able to play a whole Beethoven sonata
without notes after she had heard one of
her fellow-pupils practice it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Amy was quite young her quick ear
and good memory gave her an opportunity
to be of real service to the world. Professor
Sill, a scientist who made birds his special
study, asked her to record the songs of the
California larks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out into the fields they went together and
waited, motionless, for the birds to appear.
Then just as soon as one of the little feathered
creatures trilled out his melody, Amy
wrote it down in notes. The song thus
caught was kept for all time. She continued
this practice of recording songs so that she
finally had a volume filled with bird melodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy Cheney studied under Ernst Perabo,
Carl Baerman, and Junius W. Hill. She also
studied many musical subjects independently.
She did not always want to be helped
over the problems that confronted her, preferring
to work them out alone. Translating
books on music and memorizing and rewriting
difficult music were some of the hard
tasks that this earnest, thorough young student
set for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sixteen years of age this young pianist
made her first professional appearance before
the public at a recital in Boston, and
was greatly praised. The next year she played
with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and
with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra. During
that year a beautiful song which she had
composed, entitled <span class='it'>With Violets</span>, was published.
It was considered by musical critics
to be faultless in form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following year Amy Cheney became
the wife of Dr. H. H. A. Beach, of Boston.
She did not, however, give up her musical
career. In fact, all of her most important
pieces of music were written after her
marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Beach has composed music for the orchestra,
piano, and violin, and has also written
cantatas and many songs. One of her
most famous and successful pieces of music
is her <span class='it'>Jubilate</span> cantata, written for the dedication
of the Woman’s Building at the
World’s Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago
in 1893. At this Exposition Maud
Powell, the famous violinist, and Mrs. Beach
played one of Mrs. Beach’s compositions
written for the violin and piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music for a poem called <span class='it'>Dark Is the
Night</span> is thought by many people to be her
best song. Other favorites are: <span class='it'>Across the
World</span>, <span class='it'>Scottish Cradle Song</span>, and <span class='it'>Fairy Lullaby</span>.
Mrs. Beach’s songs are always enjoyed
by those who appreciate the best music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Success did not spoil the young girl whose
marked musical ability had attracted attention
ever since her babyhood. Not content
with what had come easily to her, Amy Marcy
Cheney Beach kept on working to develop
her talent. Her love of music and enthusiasm
for it were not alone responsible for
placing her foremost among the women composers
of America. It was her desire for
knowledge, leading her to studiously apply
herself to her work, that enabled her to create
music which has brought pleasure to
thousands of people.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Cecilia Beaux—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Whose Paint Brush Has Brought Her Fame</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecilia’s gray eyes grew thoughtful
as she considered the drawing that
she was copying. She held it at arm’s
length, scrutinizing it critically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, this is much more fun than practicing
scales,” she reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the family examined these drawings,
they said, “Cecilia would never be a
success at music, but she draws very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little girl was Cecilia Beaux, whose
portraits have won many medals. She was
born in Philadelphia in 1863. Her father
came from Provence, France, where the people
have ever been famed for their enjoyment
of beauty. Her mother was of New
England descent and had inherited from her
ancestors the ability to do things and to do
them conscientiously and well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From each parent the little girl received a
golden gift: from her father, his joy in the
beautiful; from her mother, the love of doing
things. Her good use of these two gifts
has made Cecilia Beaux a famous artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecilia was taught at home until she was
twelve years old. Then she attended a private
school for a short time. Because of the
skill that she had shown in copying drawings
her aunt and uncle, with whom she spent a
great deal of time, proposed a training in
art for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This young girl had a few lessons in drawing
from a Philadelphia artist, Mrs. Thomas
Janvier. She also had an opportunity to
have her work in painting criticized by Mr.
William Sartain. Her gray eyes shone with
happiness as she applied her colors and listened
eagerly to every word from this distinguished
teacher. Cecilia Beaux was practically
self-taught. These few lessons constituted
her only instruction in art until she
went abroad some years later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of sitting and dreaming of the
great pictures that she might paint some day,
Cecilia Beaux looked for an opportunity
to use her brush or pencil to aid her financially.
A scientific society needed some one
upon whom they could depend to make accurate
drawings of fossils. This kind of
work necessitated very careful attention to
detail. The drawings were to be made into
plates to illustrate scientific books. They
would have been useless if they had not been
exactly correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some young artists, eager to do what they
would call big things, would have been impatient
with such slow, tedious work. Cecilia
Beaux did not despise it. She did it to
the very best of her ability, just because she
believed in doing things well. Little did she
dream that this training in careful and exact
drawing was to be of great help to her when
she began to paint portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another way in which she earned money
was by giving lessons in painting and drawing.
She also found that she could increase
her income by painting portraits on china
plates, taking her subjects from photographs.
She did these very well, too, being
careful to make correct likenesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Cecilia Beaux began to make crayon
portraits from photographs. These attracted
attention and she soon received many orders
for portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One success followed another, but although
Cecilia Beaux received much praise for her
work, she was not content with what she had
accomplished. She felt that she needed still
more training and that to have it she must
go to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, Miss Beaux went to Europe
and began to broaden her talent by studying
with several great French masters. One of
them, Robert Fleury, used to summon her
before the class to praise her work publicly.
So modest was this American girl that she
thought he could not be in earnest. Her fellow-students,
also, used to discuss her excellent
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The many friends that she made in Paris
begged her to stay in that beautiful city and
paint there, but she was too thoroughly
American to spend her life in a foreign land.
So, after a few years, she returned to her
own country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great many of Miss Beaux’s best-known
pictures are of women and children, but she
has painted men with great success, too. In
fact, she was chosen to paint portraits of
Clemenceau, Admiral Beatty, and other
great war leaders. Her portraits of women
and children are really little pictures of
everyday home life. She has caught the
children as they have paused in their play
for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ernesta,” one of Miss Beaux’s well-known
portraits, hangs in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York City. Among her other
important paintings are “The Last Days of
Infancy,” “The Dancing Lesson,” “Sita and
Sarita,” and “The New England Woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecilia Beaux has won medals and prizes
at many exhibitions of art. People are glad
to pay large sums of money for her pictures,
and it is considered an honor to be painted by
her. She has steadily achieved success because
she has never scorned nor slighted
small tasks. She has done them conscientiously
and well, making them a preparation
for greater things to come.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Evangeline Booth—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Lived The Meaning of Her Name</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many a passerby on the crowded London
street paused to glance at the
earnest, thoughtful face of a slender,
golden-haired flower girl and to buy a nosegay
from her basket. When her stock was
sold this girl, as fair and fragile as one of
her own flowers, picked her way through
the throng. She presently disappeared into
one of the dirty alleyways, where only the
poorest of Londoners lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Children ran to meet her and rough men
touched their caps as she passed. The sick
woman whose wretched room she entered
fell asleep peacefully after receiving a bowl
of soup from her hands and a cheery word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For weeks this sweet-faced young girl,
who sold flowers or worked at making
matches, had been winning the hearts of the
poor, discouraged people of this district.
She tended their babies and prayed with the
lonely old women. These people felt that
they had found a friend who was sorry for
them and who was always ready to give
them aid. They called her the “White Angel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day she told these people that she was
a Salvation Army lassie. The Army was
hated in this district because it was trying
to close the saloons; only a few months earlier
its preachers had been stoned in the
streets. The “White Angel,” herself, had
been warned by the police that it would be
dangerous for her to speak in this part of
London. Yet so beloved and respected had
she become that she felt perfectly safe.
Because of her good work, the people in this
poverty-stricken and wicked district were
soon attending the meetings of the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who dared to go into the very
worst part of London to live the life of its
poor people that she might better know how
to help them was Evangeline Booth. In later
years she became the Commander-in-chief
of the Salvation Army in the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evangeline Booth’s father, William Booth,
had been apprenticed as a boy to a pawnbroker.
He was so touched by the poverty
and wickedness around him that he put his
whole soul into helping others to lead better
lives. The Mission, that he established in
London after many struggles, became in
time the Salvation Army. For years, William
Booth, General of the Army, toiled against
odds of every kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thinking world now has respect and
admiration for the splendid work that the
Salvation Army carries on. In those days,
however, the street preachers of the Army
were as likely to be showered with stones
and bricks as to be sneered and ridiculed.
The rougher people disliked the Army because
it was fighting drink and wickedness.
Other people could not see that the drum and
tambourine and simple prayers might help
to turn a man’s heart to God as readily as
could organ music and learned sermons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was into the home of the founder of this
once despised organization, at Hackney, a
suburb of London, that a seventh child,
Evangeline Booth, was born, December
1865. There was a loving welcome for the
little girl, though she had come into a home
where both mother and father believed that
their family must be second to the work that
they were doing for the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Evangeline and her sisters heard
so much of their father’s work that even
their favorite game was playing prayer
meeting with their battered dolls. She and
the others had very few toys, because their
parents thought that the money should be
spent for the poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very busy home in which Eva, as
her father preferred to call her, grew up.
The bell was always ringing. Messengers
were coming and going. In one room her
father’s deep voice might be heard planning
his work. In another room her mother was
busy writing for the Cause. The younger
children murmured their lessons in a third
room, and in a fourth, one of the older girls
practiced on the piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The General would often stop in the midst
of his work for little chats with his children.
He would take Eva, for whom he always had
a specially deep love and tenderness, upon
his knee and ask her about her puppies or
kittens. Once when Eva felt very sad over
the death of her pet dog, her father took her
to the city and spent the whole day telling
her stories and comforting her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an early age Eva learned that she
should pick up her books and toys for, above
everything else except sin, her father hated
disorder. Orderliness was a useful habit to
be acquired by one who was later to have
charge of the affairs of a great organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Eva’s mother was often too busy
to spend much time with her, she heard her
daughter’s prayers and urged her to study
so that she could help the weak, the poor, the
ignorant, and the wicked. Mrs. Booth often
reminded Eva to carry out in her life the
meaning of her beautiful name, Evangeline,
“bringing glad tidings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evangeline Booth began her work of
“bringing glad tidings” when she was very
young. She had inherited her father’s gift
of eloquence as well as his fearlessness and
love of work. At fifteen years of age she
spoke very beautifully at a meeting near
London. When she was seventeen years old
she was made an officer in the Army and began
the work in the slums which won her the
title of “White Angel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After ably filling various positions in the
Salvation Army in Great Britain, Evangeline
Booth was made Commander of the
Army in Canada. At the time of the Gold
Rush in 1898, she sent Salvation Army workers
to the Klondike. In 1904 she was made
Commander-in-chief of the Salvation Army
in the United States. Besides her duties as
Commander she has composed words and
music for the Army’s songs and has written
articles for the Army publications and other
magazines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to its religious work the Salvation
Army maintains homes, hospitals, clinics,
and day nurseries; it finds employment
for men and women out of work; and it
sends mothers and children on summer outings.
Every Christmas and Thanksgiving
pennies dropped into the big red Salvation
Army kettles provide dinners for thousands
of the poor. In a single year the Army in
the United States made 175,698 children
happy with Christmas toys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the World War the pies and doughnuts
served by the Salvation Army lassies
cheered thousands of lonely soldiers, and
many a mother has the Salvation Army to
thank for her boy’s last message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evangeline Booth was for almost twenty
years Commander-in-chief of this great
organization in the United States. She believes,
as her father did before her, that the
first step in influencing a man to lead a better
life is to make him feel that you really
care whether he sinks or swims. Her courageous,
selfless life shows that she <span class='it'>does</span> care.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Frances Hodgson Burnett—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Loved Stories And Wrote Them</p>

<p class='pindent'>From under the sitting-room table
came strange whispers, but Mrs.
Hodgson was not at all surprised.
Beneath the long overhanging cover she
could see a chubby, curly-headed little girl
seated on the floor talking in low earnest
tones to her wax doll, braced against the
table leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances, the little girl under the table,
would have described the scene very differently.
What she saw was not an ordinary
center table, but an Indian wigwam; not a
speechless doll, but a squaw to whom she, as
the chief, was telling tales of the war-trail
and the happy hunting grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frances is pretending again,” said Mrs.
Hodgson to herself as she went out of the
room, a bit puzzled at this little daughter’s
way of playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chubby little girl and her doll had
many an adventure together. They took
mad gallops on coal-black steeds that seemed
to ordinary eyes nothing but the arms of the
nursery sofa. As survivors from a sinking
ship they drifted on a raft that Frances’ two
sisters would have called the green arm
chair. These experiences seemed very real
to this little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something within little Frances’ curly
head helped her to transform the sitting-room
cupboard into a temple in Central
America and the stiff doll into Mary Queen
of Scots. It was the gift of imagination.
How surprised her family would have been
at that time had they known that this gift
was one day to make her a famous storywriter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the smoky factory town of Manchester,
England, Frances Eliza Hodgson was born,
November 24, 1849. When she was about
four years old, her sweet, gentle mother was
left a widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like other English children of families in
comfortable circumstances, the Hodgson
girls had a governess at home, before they
entered a near-by private school. The lessons
which interested Frances the most were
those that contained stories, such as certain
parts of history. She could never satisfy
her great appetite for stories, though she
read continually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were not so many good books for
children then as nowadays. Frances’ relatives
seemed to think that the birthday and
Christmas gift books were quite enough for
a little girl. Frances, however, did not agree
with them. When she made a new acquaintance
at school, she was sure to ask her, first
of all, what books she had to lend.
Sometimes when she went to visit a little friend,
she forgot her manners entirely and buried
herself in a new book, so eager was she to
read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One gloomy rainy day, Frances wandered
through the house looking for something to
read. She glanced at the tall secretary and
wished that its books looked more interesting.
However, she decided that she might at
least try one. Accordingly, she pulled out
a fat volume. It had short lines, which, to
Frances, meant conversation and a story.
She opened another book and found more
stories. Delightedly, she continued to examine
the books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances was so excited and happy that she
forgot to go to tea. She had discovered that
there were stories enough to last her for
months! It was in this way that Frances
Hodgson discovered Shakespeare’s plays,
Scott’s and Dickens’ novels, and many other
interesting books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not content with reading stories, Frances
was always telling or writing them. On the
afternoons at school when the girls were allowed
to talk quietly over their crocheting
and fancy work, Frances would tell stories
in low tones to the group of girls near her.
They were delighted with her tales and continually
begged her to tell more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At home she often wrote stories on slates
or in old account books. For fear of being
teased she rarely showed the stories to anyone
except her mother. Mrs. Hodgson always
had an encouraging word for her little
daughter’s tales and verses. This gave Frances
an added incentive to continue writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just at the close of the Civil War a great
change came into the life of the little storywriter.
Mrs. Hodgson decided to leave England
and move to America. The family fortunes
were impaired, and an uncle had
promised to find work for the boys in the
United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Romantic Frances was delighted with the
change. Her first American home was in a
tiny settlement in the forests of Tennessee.
Everything was so new and strange that she
seemed actually to be living in a story. The
next home on the top of a hill, with mountains
in the distance, was even better. How
she loved the bright sunshine, the flowers,
the birds, and her bower, a cozy retreat in
the woods!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys had not as yet been able to add
very much to the family fortunes. Frances
and her sisters did not mind worn-out frocks
and scanty meals, but they were troubled to
see their dear little mother so worried. The
girls decided that something had to be done
immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wonderful it would be,” thought
Frances, “if an editor would buy one of my
stories!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was only fifteen years old, and she did
not know how to send a story to an editor.
She had read in a magazine that contributors
must write very clearly on foolscap paper,
and enclose stamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not having sufficient money with which to
buy stamps and paper, Frances and her sisters
earned the money by selling wild grapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the story was sent, but it was done
secretly, for Frances was afraid that her
brothers would tease her. What a happy
day it was when, on its second trip, the story,
together with another, brought a check for
thirty-five dollars! She had found a way to
help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances Hodgson went on writing and
selling her stories. Soon her books became
famous. When she married Dr. S. M. Burnett,
she was able to help him complete his
education by her writing. Their son, Vivian,
is also a writer. He has been a journalist
and is the author of several books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Burnett has written many novels for
grown people as well as stories that children
love. <span class='it'>Little Lord Fauntleroy</span>, the tale of a
lovable little American boy who won the
heart of his crusty old English grandfather,
is the best known of her books for children.
Among her other well-known books are
<span class='it'>Editha’s Burglar</span>, <span class='it'>Sara Crewe</span>, <span class='it'>The Cozy
Lion</span>, <span class='it'>The Secret Garden</span>, and <span class='it'>Land of the
Blue Flower</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Burnett does not preach in her delightful
stories for children. One can, however,
easily see in her stories the lessons in
thoughtfulness and courtesy she had learned
from her mother. Frances Hodgson Burnett’s
great gift of imagination, together
with her desire to write, enabled her to give
us stories that have brought pleasure to
many people.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Katharine Bement Davis—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Has Helped To Straighten Twisted Lives</p>

<p class='pindent'>The villain had received his just deserts,
but he, or rather she, was smiling
with satisfaction. Her play, for
Katharine was the author as well as a principal
actor, had been a great success. Nobody
had forgotten a line, and, in addition,
the scenery had added a realistic setting.
Who would ever have dreamed that the deep
forest and bold cliffs were only boughs cut
from the shrubbery, and boxes covered with
mother’s old gray shawl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The back parlor of the Davis home was
crowded with a friendly audience of girls
and boys and a few mothers and fathers.
This attendance was very gratifying to
Katharine, for it assured her that the receipts
would be large. With them she intended
to provide a bountiful Thanksgiving
dinner for a good woman who was having
difficulty in supporting her crippled grandson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little did this merry eleven-year-old girl
think that the work of helping others, begun
in such a small way that night, was the
work that she was to choose for her own
later on. When she grew up she became a
sociologist. This is simply a long word for a
person who thinks, studies, plans, and works
to help people lead happier, healthier, and
better lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katharine Bement Davis was born in
Buffalo, New York, January 15, 1860. Within
a short time the family moved to Dunkirk,
New York. In the happy childhood days
spent in this town on Lake Erie, there was
no hint of the sorrow of life which Katharine
was to cheer in later years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides four younger sisters and brothers
for playmates, Kitty, as she was called, had
no end of school chums. They were always
welcome at her home, for the Davis house
was a sort of center of good times for the
neighborhood. In the winter the children
acted plays in the house; in the summer time
they played Indian in the backyard, or built
houses of kindling wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kitty was usually chief builder, because
she loved to watch something grow under
her hands. Making things was always such
a joy to her that years later, when she had
charge of the Bedford Reformatory, she
taught her girls how to do all sorts of useful
tasks. They even laid the concrete walks between
the buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little Lake Erie girl had as great an
appetite for finding out how other people
did things as for doing them herself. Once
when a friend of the family took her for a
drive, she inquired the name and use of
every part of the carriage. By the time they
reached home, her companion felt as if he
had been put through a severe examination;
but Katharine knew all about the carriage.
This habit of going to the very bottom of
things was to be of great use to a woman
who was to have hard problems to settle in
her public life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kitty Davis was very fond of reading.
Her sisters and brothers often found her
deeply absorbed in a book. Some of Scott’s
and Dickens’ novels were among the book
friends that she made at eleven and twelve
years of age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Katharine Davis liked to create
with her mind as well as with her hands.
When she was eleven years old, she had
thought out tunes for a number of hymns.
She enjoyed her music lessons, especially the
part which showed her how music is made.
The grown-up Katharine Davis realized that
music helps people to forget their troubles
and to think better thoughts. For this reason,
she made sure that her girls at the
reformatory should not only hear good music
but should sing it themselves in their own
glee club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Davis family lived Grandmother
Bement, a woman who had always had a
hand in any new movement to make the
world better. Katharine and the other children
loved to hear her tell about the escape
of slaves by means of the underground railroad,
the fight against drink, and the struggle
for rights for women. It was not
strange that the granddaughter of such a
woman should have a desire to be of service
to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The years flew on until Katharine Davis
was ready for college. Business reverses
had come to Mr. Davis, and he told his
daughter that he could not pay her expenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” answered Katharine, “I
will earn them myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kept her word. Studying by herself
while she was teaching science in the Dunkirk
High School, Katharine Davis completed
two years of college work. She then
entered Vassar College as a junior. She successfully
passed the many special examinations
that it was necessary for her to take.
Upon the completion of two years’ work at
college Katharine Davis was graduated with
honors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a number of years, Miss Davis spent
her time, first, in teaching; then, in settlement
work; and later, in further study.
After three years of graduate work, the degree
of Doctor of Philosophy, with honors,
was conferred upon her by the University
of Chicago. Thus she was ably prepared
to enter the field of social service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it was announced that a new reformatory
for women was to be opened at
Bedford, New York, Dr. Davis was immediately
interested. She thought that there
she might be able to carry out her ideas for
helping girls who had not had a pleasant
home and wise parents like her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Davis received the appointment as superintendent
of this reformatory, and set
about getting acquainted with her girls. She
believed that many of these lives that had
been started in the wrong way might turn
out happily, if some one took the trouble to
study them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Davis endeavored really to know the
girls at Bedford. She was vitally interested
in their welfare and did everything that she
could to help them. She spent many successful
years as superintendent of this reformatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Davis’ ability to grasp a situation and
meet it was clearly demonstrated at the time
of the Messina earthquake. She was in
Sicily when the disaster occurred, and immediately
set about to aid the sufferers. Her
work of rehabilitating the earthquake victims
was so important that it won for her a
Red Cross Medal, presented by President
Taft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dr. Davis took charge of all the
prisons in the city of New York, as Commissioner
of Correction, she had another opportunity
for continuing her wonderful work.
Katharine Bement Davis has served on a
number of commissions formed for the purpose
of social betterment. Many persons
who desire to learn the best ways of working
for humanity go to her for advice. Because
of the little girl who carried into later life
her joy of working and her habit of investigating
things, many twisted lives have been
straightened.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Grace Hoadley Dodge—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Worked For Working Girls</p>

<p class='pindent'>A group of prominent men and women
were sitting in the drawing room
of a beautiful home in New York
City, talking earnestly. Close by them sat a
young girl, the eldest daughter of the house.
She shyly added only an occasional word to
the conversation, but she gave very careful
attention to everything that her elders said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One member of this group was Dwight L.
Moody, the famous preacher. The girl listened
to him with particular interest, and
was deeply impressed by all he had to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were often such gatherings in this
home. No matter with what subject the
conversation started, sooner or later came
the question of how to help men and women
lead the best kind of lives. It was not
strange, then, that one day this young girl
went to her mother and said, “I have found
out what there is for me to do. I am going
to help people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is exactly what Grace Dodge did.
She helped people. Perhaps you will be surprised
to learn that she helped each one of
you girls and boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every girl who has learned in a cooking
class how to bake a wholesome loaf of bread;
every boy who brings home from school a
well-finished footstool for his mother, has
Grace Dodge to thank. Every one of your
older sisters who enjoys a swim or a game of
basketball at the Y. W. C. A. has her to thank
too. Of course, there are others to thank
as well, for every good work needs many
helpers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Grace Dodge was young, girls and
boys in the public schools were not taught
how to work with their hands; and girls who
were earning their own living had no pleasant
clubs. Grace Dodge believed strongly in
these things, and worked so earnestly all her
life for them that other people became interested
too, and gladly cooperated with her in
her beloved work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Hoadley Dodge was born in New
York City, May 21, 1855. The Dodge family
divided their time between their city home
and their beautiful country house at Riverdale
on the banks of the Hudson. Here
Grace had many a fine gallop through the
country with her brothers. Aside from these
lively rides, which she greatly enjoyed, she
lived quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as a child, Grace thought very little
about her own pleasure or herself. She liked
to talk with the workmen who kept the
beautiful lawns and gardens in order, and to
make friends with their children. Although
there were nurses and governesses in the
family, the younger sisters and brothers always
preferred to go to sister Grace when
they wanted to be comforted; and they did
not go in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Grace went shopping in the city
with her mother, she used to think that it
was very hard for girls to have to stand behind
the counter all day. “I am ashamed to
have so much while these girls have so little,”
she would many times say to herself,
wondering what she could do about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Dodge attended a private school at
Farmington, Connecticut. After her school
days were over, she began to do the work
that had always interested her. One of the
reasons that she accomplished so much was
that, whenever she saw a need for anything,
she set about to fill it. Furthermore, she
kept persistently at the work until it was
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Dodge soon discovered that many of
the girls in whom she was interested had to
work long hours in factories. She began to
find that they did not know much about
cooking, or sewing, or taking proper care of
their health. It was a great pity, she
thought, that these girls, many of whom
would soon be having homes of their own,
should know so little about the important
work of home-making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Dodge began to gather a group of
these girls about her every week, and talked
to them. She told them in a friendly, simple
way how to choose their clothes, how to keep
well and strong, and how to use their money
wisely. She told them, too, how to live the
right kind of lives and of the help that God
would give them. Often she talked to them
about the homes that they might make some
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were eager to tell her about
themselves. Each one felt that she could
consider Miss Dodge as her personal friend.
“The Irene Club,” as this group was named
after a beloved member, grew until it had
to be divided. Still the girls continued to
come. In this way clubs for working girls
were started. These clubs have proved to be
so successful that they have never stopped
growing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time, there were no places where
girls who were busy all day could learn
home-making. Miss Dodge, therefore, together
with several other young women, organized
classes for these girls in various
household subjects. Miss Dodge and her associates
soon discovered that there were
very few teachers who had been trained to
teach in this particular field. They later
found that there was a lack of highly trained
teachers in practically all of the departments
of teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Dodge began to think that there
should be a school to train teachers in the
various branches of learning. It was not
Grace Dodge’s way to stop merely with
thinking. She began to work for this school,
and, largely because of her efforts, Teachers
College of Columbia University rose on
Morningside Heights in New York City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every year this college sends out thousands
of men and women prepared to teach
all the school subjects. The wonderful work
that Teachers College is accomplishing is
due, in a large measure, to the inspiration
and guidance that Grace Dodge gave to the
college throughout her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In many other ways Grace Dodge carried
on her work of helpfulness. She was the
first woman to serve on the Board of Education
of New York City. Because of her pity
for women and children who were unprotected
and bewildered in travel, she organized
the Travelers’ Aid Society. So firm was
her belief in what the Young Women’s Christian
Association does for girls that she
worked to make it a strong organization.
She was the president of its national board
for eight years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Dodge often called herself “a working
girl whose wages were paid in advance.”
Her money meant to her merely a means for
doing good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Hoadley Dodge was unselfish and
determined to fill the need that she saw.
Through her efforts, school girls and boys
now have many opportunities to use hand
and brain together. It was because of her
great interest in others that she brought joy
into the life of many a wage-earning girl
and helped to fit her for her work of home-making.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Alice Cunningham Fletcher—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Befriended The Red Man</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once upon a time there lived a little
girl named Alice, who loved to sit
upon the shore and listen to the song
of the waves. She also liked to climb a high
hill and look far off at the blue sky and the
green slopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At home she had plenty of good books to
read, and she loved them too. They told her
delightful stories about things that had happened
long ago. Sometimes she did not
quite understand all that they said, as she
read them curled up by the fire, but later,
when she wandered in the woods, their
meaning became clearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same way when she played on
the piano at home. The music set her to
dreaming, and called forth puzzling
thoughts. Outdoors she seemed to understand
better what the music had to tell her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little girl was Alice Cunningham
Fletcher. She was born in Boston, Massachusetts,
in 1845. As she grew older, the
thought came to her that if she felt so happy
out in the open, how must the Indians feel
who had lived a free out-of-door life for generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually she began to think that these
people, whom the world called savages, must
have learned something about how to live
happily. Alice Fletcher resolved that, if
ever there came a time when it was possible,
she would go to the home of the Indians and
try to discover their secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile she studied all that books and
museums could teach her of the story of the
Red Men. At last, there did come a day
when she decided to go and live among them.
It meant leaving behind her, beloved libraries,
fine concerts, beautiful pictures, and
even a comfortable bed and easy chair. Miss
Fletcher felt, however, that there was something
that meant more than comfort to her.
It was the doing of a definite piece of work
that she believed would be useful to the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, she left the friends with whom
she could talk of books, pictures, and music,
and went to live among the Dakota and
Omaha Indians. From the door of her rude
wigwam of buffalo skins, she could watch
the little Indian children at play and see the
everyday life of the older members of the
tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most people think of the American Indian
as a reserved, stern sort of person who
never laughs or jokes. What Miss Fletcher
saw from her wigwam gave her an entirely
different opinion. She saw the Indians enjoy
fun, and take a wide-awake interest in
everything that went on around them. She
decided that the sternness of the Indian was
only a kind of mask that he wore before
strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the New England woman ceased to
be a stranger to her Indian neighbors. The
love that they both had for the sky, the
wind, the streams, and the forest helped to
make them understand one another. It was
not long before these children of Nature
realized that Miss Fletcher had come to
them as a friend; and that she was really interested
in them. So they dropped their
mask of reserve and let her know them as
they really were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Fletcher, always a lover of music, became
greatly interested in the music of the
Indians. She found, however, that it was
very difficult to study. An Indian does not
sing just to be heard, but to express some
feeling. His singing is a kind of prayer. It
was only stray bits of such music that she
was able to overhear and write down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Miss Fletcher had a severe illness
which turned out to be a blessing, in one respect.
When her Indian friends discovered
that she really wanted to hear their music,
they gathered about her bed and sang for
her. To please her, they even were willing
to sing into a phonograph, which was to
them a strange machine. Thus their songs
were preserved for all time. Miss Fletcher
has written a book entitled <span class='it'>Indian Story and
Song from North America</span>. This book has
already suggested themes for a number of
American musical compositions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a chance to prove that she was
really a friend of the Indians came to Alice
Fletcher. Some greedy white men were trying
to get the good land away from the Red
Men, giving them poorer land in return.
Sometimes the Indians were so enraged with
their treatment that they would rise in revolt.
The situation kept growing worse and
worse. Miss Fletcher realized that it would
be no better unless each Indian secured from
the government the right to hold a portion
of the tribal land for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She set out for Washington to try to persuade
Congress that the Indians must hold
their land just as the white man holds his. A
book which had just appeared, written by
Helen Hunt Jackson, called <span class='it'>A Century of
Dishonor</span>, helped a little to make people realize
the wrongs done to the Indians. However,
the congressmen were much more interested
in the affairs of their own people
than in the Indians. Miss Fletcher, therefore,
had to plead their cause continually until
the Indian Land Act was finally passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The President asked Miss Fletcher to undertake
the difficult task of allotting the
tracts of land to the Omaha Indians. He
knew that they trusted her and would be
content with her judgment. Later she did
the same work for other tribes of Indians
to the satisfaction of everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Girl and Boy Scouts and the Campfire
Girls have interested Miss Fletcher very
much, because she believes that the outdoors
can bring health and happiness to girls and
boys. She has made a collection of Indian
games for these organizations. Also, Miss
Fletcher has written books and articles
about the Indians. Her writings are a great
help to those who are making a special study
of the different people of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Cunningham Fletcher gave up luxury
and even comfort to learn about the Indians.
The work of her mind has been of
great value to learned people in their study
of races; and the work of her heart will
never be forgotten by the simple folk whose
wrongs she helped to right.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Louise Homer—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Who Believes That Hard Work Is The Secret of Her Success as a Singer</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise paid no attention to the calls of
the children. What were a few hours’
lost play compared with the treat in
store for her! To-night after the regular
prayer meeting, a song service was to be
held to study hymns. Louise had begged so
hard to be allowed to attend that her father
had consented, provided that her lessons
were thoroughly prepared in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These midweek song services were held
at the Minneapolis church of which her father
was pastor. There, Louise Beatty sang
for the first time outside her own home.
Little did this girl realize that her rich, deep
voice would later make her famous throughout
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise Dilworth Beatty was born in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, in 1872, into a family
where playing and singing were as much a
part of the daily program as eating or sleeping.
Every one of the eight Beatty children
loved music. They were always singing in
duets, trios, quartets, or choruses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gathered around the fire on winter evenings,
the family formed an impromptu orchestra.
One sister played the piano; a
brother, the bones; Mr. Beatty, the flute;
and Louise, the future great opera singer,
the triangle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music had always delighted Louise, in
particular. At school, the seven-year-old
girl was stirred day after day by the thrilling
notes of the music which the teacher
played as the pupils marched out for recess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Louise was fourteen years old, she
made her first appearance in public as a soloist.
The church in the little Pennsylvania
town where the family was then living was
to give the cantata, <span class='it'>Ruth and Naomi</span>. Mrs.
Beatty was rather amused when Louise was
asked to take the part of Ruth, for she had
never sung alone; but Louise herself was delighted.
The rehearsals were a joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the night set for the cantata, just as
the singers were assembling, the disturbing
news came that the man who was to sing the
part of Boaz had missed his train. What
was to be done! “I will sing his part too,”
offered Louise. She carried the basso-profundo
part, in addition to her own, with such
success that everyone told her mother that
Louise’s voice was wonderful, and that it
should be cultivated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this Louise began to take singing
lessons, but the thought of becoming an
opera singer did not occur to her. She kept
busy with her high-school work, and later
on studied music in Philadelphia. She also
sang in a church there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day Louise Beatty took the most
important step in her life. She decided to go
to Boston to study music seriously. She felt
that she must know more about music itself,
if she were to become a real singer. She was
advised to study harmony and composition
with Sidney Homer, well known as a writer
of music. She began her lessons with Mr.
Homer, and, in addition, studied singing
with William L. Whitney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1895 Louise Beatty and Sidney Homer
were married. Mr. Homer believed that his
wife’s voice was unusual, and that it was especially
suited for opera. He wanted her to
go abroad to train herself to be an opera
singer. Accordingly, they went to Paris,
where Madame Homer studied very hard for
two years. She was able to do a tremendous
amount of work without injuring her health,
because she lived quietly and ate good home
food at regular hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the reward of the long hours
spent in singing with her teachers, in practicing,
and in studying languages and
dramatics. Madame Homer was ready to sing
in opera. In America, she appeared for the
first time in San Francisco in the opera <span class='it'>Aida</span>,
and a few weeks later in New York in the
same part. She was a success at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years Louise Homer has delighted
American audiences with her beautiful
contralto voice. To keep her voice in
good condition, and to learn the many parts
that she has sung has not been an easy task.
Every day during the season she practices
and studies. Madame Homer believes that
a great name, once made, can only be kept
by thorough work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Madame Homer has never slighted
any part of the work of her profession, neither
has she neglected the work of home-making.
She has always found time to be an intelligent
and affectionate mother to her children
and to preside over a real home. Remembering
her own happy childhood, she has
been determined that her children should
have as much love and care and good training
as her own mother gave her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise, the eldest daughter, has a good
mezzo voice and has sung in recitals, sometimes
with her mother. Sidney, the second
child, has also inherited musical ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Homer and her husband have always
been intensely interested in each other’s
work. The wife loves to sing the songs her
husband composes, and he in turn takes delight
in dedicating them to her. Louise
Homer possessed a remarkable voice, but
her own painstaking and constant work
has brought it to perfection.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Harriet Goodhue Hosmer—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Loved Art More Than Ease</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bats, birds, toads, snakes, and beetles
filled the room. Some were stuffed
and mounted, and the others were
either dissected or preserved in alcohol.
This room was neither a museum nor a boy’s
den. It was owned by a little girl known as
“Happy Hatty,” and she, herself, had collected
and prepared every one of its strange
ornaments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time that Harriet Hosmer was
young, dissecting animals was not considered
a proper amusement for a girl. The
neighbors thought that Harriet would have
been much better employed in sewing a fine
seam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet’s father, an eminent physician,
had his own ideas about bringing up his little
girl. Dr. Hosmer wanted her to live in
the fresh air and sunshine so that she would
be strong and healthy. The more Harriet
ranged the woods in search of specimens, the
better her father was pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Hosmer gave his little girl a boat, so
that she could row on the Charles River,
which flowed past her home. He had a Venetian
gondola made for her, too, with velvet
cushions and a silver prow. In fact, he
thought that no gift was too rich for his
little girl, so long as it would keep her in the
open air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet enjoyed out-of-door life. She
grew tall and strong. Her muscles became
firm from much rowing. She could walk
miles without being tired, and was a fearless
rider. Thus, unknowingly, did this little
girl, who later became a distinguished sculptor,
lay a strong foundation for her life
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Goodhue Hosmer was born in
Watertown, Massachusetts, on October 9,
1830. Even as a child she liked to play with
clay and mold it into shapes. In one corner
of the garden there was a clay-pit. Here the
little girl used to go, when she grew tired of
books, to fashion dogs and horses from the
wet clay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet went to school in Watertown, and
later attended a private school at Lenox,
Massachusetts. After three years at Lenox,
Harriet returned home. She then began to
study drawing and modeling in Boston. Often
she walked both to and from her lessons,
a distance of fourteen miles. By this time,
Harriet Hosmer realized that nothing made
her happier than to turn formless bits of clay
into beautiful objects. She felt that she
would like to go still further in her work; she
wanted to see some of her ideas take shape
in marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet knew that a sculptor cannot fashion
life-like figures of people or animals
without understanding the position and
shape of the bony frame under the flesh.
The decorations of her museum-like room,
all those specimens that she had dissected or
mounted as a child, had given her a fair
start in the study of anatomy. She also
studied this subject with her father. However,
she realized that, if she were to be a
real sculptor, she must know more about
anatomy. She consequently looked about
for a school where she might study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Boston Medical School would not accept
this eager young student because she
was a girl, but Harriet Hosmer was not a
person to be daunted by one refusal. She
was finally admitted to the St. Louis Medical
College where she had a very thorough
course in anatomy. After she had completed
this course, she returned home and began to
work seriously in a studio which her father
had fitted up for her in his garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful girl representing Hesper, the
evening star, was the subject that Harriet
Hosmer chose for her first original statue.
From a solid block of marble she had a workman
knock off the corners. As he was not
accustomed to working for sculptors she did
not allow him to go within several inches of
the part that she was to cut. All the rest of
this difficult work she did with her own small
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For eight or ten hours a day she chipped
away at the block with chisel and a leaden
mallet weighing four pounds and a half.
Muscles made strong and flexible by much
rowing and other exercises enabled her to
keep up this hard work day after day. The
block of marble was finally turned into the
head of a lovely maiden, her hair entwined
with poppies and a star on her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful as was this head of Hesper,
Harriet Hosmer felt that she must study
more. She was very desirous of entering
the studio of John Gibson, a noted English
sculptor who was then residing in Rome.
Now Mr. Gibson, hearing that Miss Hosmer
was young and rich, feared that she might
be easily discouraged before real difficulties.
However, as soon as he saw the daguerreotypes
of her “Hesper,” the great sculptor
said to her father, “Whatever I can teach
her, she shall learn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the very beginning of her work with
Mr. Gibson, Harriet Hosmer showed him
that she was not the sort of girl who gives
up easily. The iron rod in a clay copy of the
Venus de Milo which she had modeled in
order that her teacher might have an idea of
her work snapped, and the figure fell to
pieces. However, without stopping to complain,
she started at once to make another
model.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Hosmer continued to work steadily
with John Gibson. Then one day a message
came from her father stating that he
had lost his fortune and could no longer send
her money. Miss Hosmer sold her fine saddle
horse, and took an inexpensive room for
herself. Now she was actually to work for
her living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Hosmer became an important figure
in the art and literary circles in Rome. She
numbered among her friends the Brownings,
Hawthorne, the Thackerays, and many other
interesting people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the years that followed, many a beautiful
statue emerged from unshaped marble
through the transforming touch of Harriet
Hosmer’s hands. Her statue “Puck” shows
a merry little elf, sitting cross-legged on a
toadstool, his left hand resting upon a lizard,
his right, clasping a beetle. Some of her
other important statues are “Œnone,”
“Beatrice Cenci,” “Sleeping Faun,” and a
statue of Thomas H. Benton. “Zenobia in
Chains,” which is in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, is the most famous of all. This
is a colossal statue, representing the beautiful
Queen of Palmyra taken prisoner by the
Roman Emperor Aurelian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Goodhue Hosmer so loved to
watch beauty grow under her fingers that
she was willing to give up the care-free, easy
life that she might have had as the child of a
rich man. Because she developed her talent
through hard, serious work, she won for
herself a high place among the sculptors of
America.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Julia Ward Howe—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Whose Battle Hymn Sang Itself Into the Hearts of a Nation</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days when New York was not the
big city that it is now, there was a fashionable
section called the Bowling Green.
The people who lived there often used to see
a great yellow coach roll by. Within, three
little girls sat stiffly against the bright blue
cushions. These children were dressed in
blue coats and yellow satin bonnets to match
the chariot and its lining. They were the
three little Ward children, one of them, Julia,
to be known later throughout the land as
Julia Ward Howe. She is the author of the
famous patriotic hymn which you sing so
often at school, the “Battle Hymn of the Republic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia Ward, the eldest of the three little
girls, was born in New York City, May 27,
1819. Although her father was a rich man
and loved his children very dearly, they did
not have many of the pleasures which most
children to-day enjoy as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ward girls had very little chance to
romp and play outdoors and get acquainted
with the birds and flowers. To be sure, they
went to Newport, Rhode Island, in the summer,
but poor little Julia had to wear a thick
green worsted veil to protect her delicate
skin. It was not until she had children of
her own that she realized how much she had
missed in her youth. She was glad that her
children could live close to Nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia was, however, a happy child in spite
of her rather sober life. She was alone much
of the time, for her lively brothers were
away at school and the two younger sisters
played by themselves; but she was never
lonely. She read a great deal: Shakespeare,
Byron, and as much other poetry as she
could find. She enjoyed her music and other
lessons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia was particularly fond of study. At
first she had lessons at home, but at the age
of nine she was sent to a private school nearby.
Here this little girl studied a difficult
book, Paley’s <span class='it'>Moral Philosophy</span>, with girls of
sixteen and eighteen years of age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, at this time, she heard a class reciting
an Italian lesson. The musical sound of
the language delighted her, and she listened
whenever she had the chance. She secured
a grammar, and studied it by herself. Then,
one day, she handed the surprised teacher a
letter, written correctly in Italian, asking
permission to join the class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia loved to make up poetry, and when
she was in her thirteenth year, she copied a
number of her poems into a brown blank
book as a present for her father. One of
them was a poem written about her mother,
whom she had lost when she was only six
years old. Still another was in French; and
in the four stanzas there was only one mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The study of languages was always a delight
to her. She spoke and wrote French
and German very well. Later in life she
studied Spanish, and at the age of fifty she
did not feel that she was too old to begin the
study of Greek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At twenty-four years of age Julia Ward
married Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe. He was
a noble-hearted man whom everyone knew
as the first person to teach language to a
blind deaf mute, namely, Laura Bridgman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A happy, busy time began for these two
people, who believed that life should be lived
for others. Dr. Howe was engaged with his
work for the blind and for the freeing of the
slaves. Mrs. Howe went on with her studies,
and wrote poems, plays, and essays. She
helped her husband with his antislavery
work, and together they edited a newspaper
called the <span class='it'>Commonwealth</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet no matter how crowded these days
were, there was always a time in the afternoon
that was set aside for the children. The
mother played and sang to the little folks,
and there were merry romps, as the father,
wrapped in a big fur coat, played bear and
growled fiercely. Both mother and father
often read aloud to their children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Civil War broke out, Julia
Ward Howe longed to help her country and
soon a special way came. One day, she was
driving back into Washington with friends,
after having witnessed a review of some
troops. Their carriage was delayed by the
returning soldiers. To pass away the time,
Mrs. Howe and her companions began to
sing war songs. Among them, they sang,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in
the grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you not write some good words
for that stirring tune?” someone asked Mrs.
Howe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have often wished to do so!” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Mrs. Howe awoke before
dawn, and found the words of a song
shaping themselves in her mind. As soon as
the poem was complete, she rose and, in the
early morning light, wrote it down on a
sheet of paper. This poem was the famous
“Battle Hymn of the Republic,” which soon
sang itself into the hearts of the nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Howe’s writings have been numerous.
In addition to her books of poetry she also
wrote much in behalf of social reforms. She
lectured far and wide, and loved to talk to
school children. Because she wanted women
to learn how to help themselves, she founded,
or helped to found, many clubs and organizations
for them. She wanted them to
have the vote too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Howe’s children have followed in
their mother’s footsteps and written books
themselves. One of her daughters, Laura E.
Richards, has written delightful stories for
children. Her book, <span class='it'>Two Noble Lives</span>, tells
very beautifully the life stories of her remarkable
mother and father. Maud Howe
Elliott and Florence Howe Hall are also the
authors of many books. The son, Henry
Marion Howe, has written books on scientific
subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our country honors Julia Ward Howe as
the author of one of its greatest songs,
which will ever continue to stir our patriotism.
Because as a girl she made the best use
of her talents, she was enabled to fill a long
life with great service.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Helen Keller—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Deaf and Blind Girl Who Found Light and Happiness Through Knowledge</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a beautiful southern garden where
birds sang gaily and roses, honeysuckle,
and jessamine shed their fragrance, little
Helen lay face downward on the ground.
She hid her hot cheeks in the cool leaves and
grass. The tears flowed fast. Why, why
would no one understand what she wanted?
Sometimes it seemed as if she could not bear
the world of darkness and silence in which
she lived. This little girl could not talk like
other children. Neither could she see the
yellow rose petals, nor hear the songs of the
birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On June 27, 1880, Helen Keller was born in
the little Alabama town of Tuscumbia. For
nineteen months she was just like any other
happy, healthy baby girl. Then a severe illness
took away her sight and hearing, and,
because she was unable to hear her baby
words, she soon forgot how to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day when Helen was nearly seven
years old, a new doll was put into her arms.
Then, in her hand a lady made the letters
<span class='it'>d-o-l-l</span> in the deaf alphabet. Helen did not
know that things had names, but she was
amused with this new game and imitated the
letters for her mother. Helen’s new friend
and teacher was Miss Anne Sullivan. She
had come from the Perkins Institution for
the Blind, in Boston, to teach this little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the finger game had been going on
for a month, Miss Sullivan spelled the word,
<span class='it'>w-a-t-e-r</span>, into Helen’s hand, letting her feel
the water from the pump. A light broke
over Helen’s face. For the first time she
understood that everything had a name. She
touched the pump and the trellis, and asked
for their names. In a few hours she had
learned thirty new words. That night Helen
went to bed very happy, looking forward,
for the first time in her life, to another day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new, joyous life now began for this little
girl whose mind had been in the dark. She
soon realized that every word that she would
learn would provide her with a new and
pleasant thought. Miss Sullivan gave Helen
slips of cardboard on which words were
printed in raised letters. She never tired of
playing the game of arranging these words
in sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down by the river Helen built dams of
pebbles and dug lakes and bays and was
taught how the world is made. In the woods
her teacher put a violet or dogwood blossom
in her hand and explained about growing
things. She learned to know the crickets
and katydids by holding them in her hand.
Helen played all these games, not realizing
that she was learning lessons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Helen was eight years old, Miss Sullivan
took her to Boston to the Perkins Institution
for the Blind. The child was delighted
to find there little girls and boys who
could talk to her in the language of the hand.
She enjoyed, too, the books in the library
printed in raised type, and began to read in
earnest. It was at this time that she climbed
Bunker Hill Monument, counting every
step. She had another lesson in history at
Plymouth Rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was difficult, of course, for Helen to
talk with people who did not know the deaf
alphabet. Miss Sullivan had to spell out the
conversation into her hand. When Helen
heard of a deaf girl who had been taught
to speak, she was determined to learn too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the hardest task that she had undertaken,
for she could not hear the sound
of her own voice nor see the lips of others.
She would feel the position of her teacher’s
tongue and lips when making a sound, and
then imitate the motions. Constant practice
and the great desire to achieve always
spurred her efforts. It was slow, tedious
work, but Helen persevered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She <span class='it'>did</span> succeed in learning to speak. It
was a very happy day when Helen actually
spoke to her parents and to her little sister
Mildred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At ten years of age Helen had put her
whole heart and will into learning to speak.
Six years later, after having studied lip-reading,
French and German, and other difficult
subjects, she determined to undertake
what seemed like another impossibility. She
made up her mind to go to college!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the books that she needed were
not printed in raised type. She could not
hear lectures nor take notes. Such were a
few of the difficulties that this young girl
had to face. Nevertheless, Helen was not to
be discouraged. She entered the Cambridge
School for Young Ladies and bravely began
her preparation for Radcliffe College.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Sullivan went to Helen’s classes with
her and spelled into her hand all that the
teachers said. Helen wrote her compositions
on the typewriter. She used it, too, in
answering successfully the examination
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen was urged to take special work at
college, but she preferred to follow the regular
course. Once more this blind and deaf
girl conquered all the difficulties, and in 1904
was graduated from Radcliffe College. She
had completed the same course as had the
young women at Radcliffe College and the
young men at Harvard University who could
see and hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Helen Keller grew older, she realized
that knowledge, besides giving pleasure, enables
one to be of more help in the world.
After her graduation she was eager to be of
service. Naturally, she thought of the blind
first. Miss Keller was made a member of
the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind
and served on several boards for the blind
and deaf. She has always urged that the
blind be given the kind of education that will
fit them to support themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Keller has written many magazine
articles and several books. When she was
only twelve years old she wrote a short account
of her life for the <span class='it'>Youth’s Companion</span>.
Her <span class='it'>The Story of My Life</span> was published before
her graduation from college.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of being a burden, this blind and
deaf girl early became a happy, useful citizen.
She has succeeded because she was
determined to know more, no matter how
much hard work it cost her. Helen Keller
says that the worst darkness is ignorance.
Her life motto has been: “Knowledge is
love and light and vision.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Maria Mitchell—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Studied the Stars</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an eventful day in the Mitchell
home. The parlor window had been taken
out and the telescope mounted in
front of it. Twelve-year-old Maria, at her
father’s side, counted the seconds while he
observed a total eclipse of the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not every twelve-year-old girl could be
trusted to use the chronometer, an instrument
which measures the time even more
accurately than a watch. Maria, however,
had been helping her father in his study of
the stars ever since she could count. Before
many years this little girl beside the telescope
became America’s best-known woman
astronomer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the little three-cornered island of Nantucket,
off the coast of Massachusetts, Maria
Mitchell was born, August 1, 1818. With its
broad sandy beaches, its wide moors, and
ocean breezes, the island was a delightful
spot in which to grow up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mitchell home was a pleasant place,
filled with the laughter and fun of a large
family of children. Due to the mother’s
careful planning, the wheels of the household
machinery ran very smoothly. No one
would have guessed, by seeing the cheerful,
comfortable home, how far Mrs. Mitchell
had to stretch a tiny income.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Work and play were happily mingled. Little
Maria, with her sisters, learned to cook
and sew. Maria was always ready to do her
share of the household work. If she swept a
room, she did it thoroughly. When she arranged
the furniture it might not be done
artistically, but every piece was straight.
She could not bear to have things crooked.
This exactness about little things was one
of the qualities that made it possible for this
girl to become a great astronomer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were always good books in the Mitchell
home. They were read over and over,
and were very carefully handled. One textbook,
an algebra, was used by eight children,
in succession, each child adding his name inside
the cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mitchell, who was a Quaker, enjoyed
quoting to his children from the Bible and
from the poets. He was particularly fond of
references to his beloved stars. He often
said that an astronomer could not fail to believe
in God. One of the earliest poems that
Maria learned was about the heavens, beginning,
“The spacious firmament on high.”
She used to like to say it over to herself when,
in later years she was frightened or troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most unusual object in Maria’s home
was her father’s telescope. On pleasant
evenings it was set up in the back yard.
Ever since boyhood Mr. Mitchell had been
interested in the stars and had made astronomy
his special study. Every clear evening
he observed the heavens. Maria was always
glad to help him. Soon she took as keen a
delight in watching the sky as he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chronometers of all the whale ships
which sailed into Nantucket were brought
to Mr. Mitchell to be “rated,” as it was called.
Maria used to help her father with this; and
at a very early age learned how to use a
measuring instrument called the sextant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no school at this time where
Maria Mitchell could be taught astronomy.
Even Harvard University had no better telescope
than her father’s. Maria, however,
had an excellent teacher in him. Many scientists
sought out Mr. Mitchell in remote Nantucket,
and Maria had the benefit of their
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The years of Maria Mitchell’s girlhood
passed quietly but happily. She went to two
schools that her father taught, and then to a
private school where she did very good work
in mathematics. At sixteen years of age she
began to teach. She gave up teaching, however,
to become librarian of the Nantucket
Athenæum, a position that she held for nearly
twenty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The library was open only afternoons and
Saturday evenings. In the afternoons there
were few visitors, so Miss Mitchell had
plenty of time for reading and study. She
went on with her studies in higher mathematics
and worked out difficult astronomical
problems. Whenever visitors came in
and chatted, as they liked to do with this
bright, interesting young woman, her book
was dropped for knitting. Maria Mitchell
never wasted a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every clear evening was spent on the
housetop observing the heavens. No matter
how many guests there were in the parlor,
Miss Mitchell would slip out and, lantern in
hand, mount to the roof where the telescope
was now kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On October 1, 1847, there was a party at
the Mitchell home. Maria, as usual, ran up
to the telescope. Presently she hurried back
and told her father that she had seen a new
comet. Mr. Mitchell was convinced that she
was right and he wrote to Harvard University,
announcing the discovery. Maria Mitchell
received for this discovery a gold medal
offered sixteen years before, by the King of
Denmark, to the first discoverer of a telescopic
comet. This won world-wide distinction
for Miss Mitchell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next year another great honor came
to the Nantucket girl. She was elected to
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
She was the first woman to be admitted to
this important scientific society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this Miss Mitchell was asked to
put her knowledge of astronomy to use on a
work for navigators called the <span class='it'>American
Nautical Almanac</span>. She was to watch the
course of the planet Venus, and to make the
tables which mariners need to guide them.
For nineteen years she kept up this important
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite natural that a woman who
had watched ships pass her island home ever
since childhood should long to travel. Miss
Mitchell was especially eager to meet the
great scientists of Europe. At last the
happy time came for a European trip.
Everywhere she was cordially received, and
astronomers not only opened their observatories
to her, but welcomed her in their
homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after Vassar College was opened,
Maria Mitchell was asked to become its professor
of astronomy and director of the observatory.
Accepting this position meant
giving up to a great extent her own studies
and the hopes of making more discoveries
in the heavens. However, Miss Mitchell was
very anxious that women should have a
chance for higher education. Therefore, she
put her own ambitions aside and threw herself
into the work of teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hundreds who knew her at Vassar will
say that she chose wisely. She was honored
as a remarkable teacher and loved as a friend
and adviser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mitchell was a prominent member of
many important organizations. Several colleges
conferred degrees upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1905 Maria Mitchell was elected to the
Hall of Fame. This hall, which is situated on
the grounds of New York University, was
built to commemorate the achievements of
distinguished citizens of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maria Mitchell lives in the memory of
scientists as a great astronomer. She lives
in the hearts of her students as one who
taught the beauty of thorough and accurate
work, and of lives free from pretense and
sham.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Alice Freeman Palmer—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Guided College Girls</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Freeman lifted his five-year-old
daughter to the platform to speak
her piece. Little Alice had been allowed
to go comfortably to sleep during the
earlier part of the village entertainment.
However, as soon as she was on her feet, all
traces of drowsiness disappeared. She loved
the bit of poetry that she had taught herself.
With rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes,
she declaimed it so enthusiastically that the
whole roomful of people burst into delighted
clapping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing smiling faces all about her, Alice
smiled, too, and put her little hands together
and clapped as vigorously as anyone. She
did not realize that it was she herself who
had given the audience pleasure. Because
these friends and neighbors were happy, she
was happy with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she grew up, Alice Freeman could
still forget herself and enter into the moods
of others. She seemed to know exactly how
the other person felt. That was one of the
reasons why, when she became the president
of Wellesley College, she was able to help the
students make the very best of their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This first public appearance of Alice Elvira
Freeman was in the country village of
Colesville, New York, where she was born,
February 21, 1855. Her father was a young
farmer, high-minded and hard working.
Her mother was a farmer’s daughter and
had been a school teacher. Both parents
were very deeply religious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Freeman was so busy cooking and
churning and washing that five-year-old
Alice helped her all that she could. She
washed dishes, gathered eggs from the barn,
and looked after the three younger children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years later there was even more need
of Alice’s help. Mr. Freeman had decided to
become a doctor, and his young wife had
bravely undertaken to carry on the farm
alone while he was studying. The two little
sisters and the brother depended on Alice to
fasten their buttons and to amuse them.
Thus from a very early age Alice Freeman
had to think for others as well as for herself.
Such training was of great value to
her when she had to care for a large family
of Wellesley College girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Alice’s father began to practice
medicine in the village of Windsor, New
York, Alice loved to drive with him and hold
the horse during his visits to patients. She
was interested in hearing about his cases
and she enjoyed the shady roads and wayside
flowers. Throughout her whole life,
she rejoiced that she had been a country
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At ten years of age Alice Freeman became
an eager pupil at the Windsor Academy.
One of her teachers, who had taken a great
interest in her throughout her course, inspired
Alice to go to college.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Alice talked the matter over with
her father, he said that he could not afford
to send her to college. He felt that, as there
was only money enough for one college education
in the family, the boy must have it.
Alice begged very hard to go. She promised
to send her brother through college, and to
give to her sisters whatever education they
desired. Dr. Freeman at length consented
to her entering the University of Michigan.
As for her promise, she kept it to the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the University Alice was confronted
with her next big problem. She failed to
pass her entrance examinations! The President
had already talked with the earnest,
intelligent seventeen-year-old girl. He realized
that her school, though a good one, had
not prepared her for college. Therefore he
asked the examiners to allow her to enter on
a six weeks’ trial. At the end of that time,
there was no doubt of Alice Freeman’s ability
to lead her classmates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This frail girl made up all the studies required
for entrance, did excellent work in
her classes, and took an active part in the
college clubs. She went to church twice on
Sunday and attended a midweek service.
She taught a Sunday-school class and put
new life into the Christian Association. She
was never too busy to be friendly, cheerful,
and joyous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Freeman received her Bachelor’s degree
after four years of college work. Three
years later, after having taught successfully
in the middle west, she was asked to become
the head of the history department at
Wellesley College. In 1881, when she was
only twenty-six years old, Miss Freeman
was made its president.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As college president Miss Freeman led a
very busy life. The college was young and
needed to be guided carefully. She worked
so lovingly and enthusiastically for it that
more students applied than could be admitted.
Wealthy people gave money for
scholarships, and many new schools were
started to prepare students for college.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Freeman was a real mother to the
large family of Wellesley College girls. They
were free to go to her with all their problems,
and they never went in vain. She had a way
of seeing the best thing in a girl and of making
her feel that she must bring the whole up
to this level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After six years of this devoted service to
Wellesley College, Alice Freeman was married
to George Herbert Palmer, then Professor
of Philosophy at Harvard University.
Happy years followed for them. Mrs. Palmer
was as successful a home-maker as she
had been a college president. She was a delightful
hostess to the many interesting
guests that were welcomed at their home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Palmer still found plenty of work to
do for others. She was a trustee of Wellesley
College, a member of the Massachusetts
State Board of Education, and the president
of the International Institute for Girls in
Spain. She always could find time for any
cause which was to make the world wiser
and better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From all over the country Mrs. Palmer’s
advice was sought on whatever had to do
with education. Many colleges and universities
conferred degrees upon her. In 1920
her name was greatly honored by being selected
for the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Freeman Palmer, college president
and great educator, never lost the child
Alice’s gift of sympathy. She cared very
deeply what people did with their lives. That
was why she could inspire them to be of real
service.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Maud Powell—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Whose Violin Spread Afar The Message of Music</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sweet strains of one of Mozart’s
violin sonatas filled the room. One of
the players was a bright-eyed little
girl. The other, it was easy to guess from the
proud and tender look that she gave her little
companion, was the child’s mother. Both
mother and daughter loved these hours together
with their violins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music meant much to this mother. She enjoyed
composing as well as playing. She was
very happy to know that music gave pleasure
to her little daughter also. The hope was in
this mother’s heart that some day little
Maud would be a great musician. It was a
hope that was realized, for, in later years,
Maud Powell became known as the foremost
American violinist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maud Powell was born in Peru, Illinois,
August 22, 1868. When she was two years
old, the family moved to Aurora, Illinois,
where, for several years, her father was head
of the public schools. From the time that
little Maud was a baby she loved music.
When she was only four years old, she was
taught to play simple pieces on the piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an early age she showed such fondness
for the violin that Mr. and Mrs. Powell decided
to have her study in Chicago with Mr.
William Lewis. Twice every week little
Maud had to travel on the train, forty miles
each way, to take her lessons. She had to go
alone, too, because money could not be spared
to pay the fare of a companion. The little
musician enjoyed these lessons very much.
After she grew up she did not forget this
teacher, and often said that he had given her
a splendid foundation for her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she was ten years old, the little
violinist played in public as a soloist with the
Chicago Ladies Vocal Quartet. By the time
that she was twelve years old, it was quite
evident that Maud Powell had real talent for
the violin. Then, her parents decided that
their little girl must be given the best possible
musical education. They fully realized
that this would be very expensive, and would
necessitate a long absence from home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Maud said good-by to her dear
father and all her young friends, and sailed
away to Germany with her mother to study
music. Mr. Powell missed his little girl and
her mother very much, but he was proud
when he received letters telling of his daughter’s
success. The good news helped him to
work harder so as to be able to send them the
necessary money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After studying at Leipzig, the little American
girl passed a brilliant examination, and
was chosen to play at a public concert.
Later, Mrs. Powell was anxious to have her
daughter study with a distinguished French
teacher, Charles Dancla, at the Paris Conservatory.
Maud learned that there were only
a few new pupils to be admitted and that she
would be one of eighty applicants. The examinations
were made especially severe for
foreigners, but Maud Powell was the first
to be admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Frenchman delighted in teaching the
eager young American girl. He took great
pains with her, and was always just and fair.
After having had but three lessons on a selection
on which a class of eighty-four was
to be examined, Maud Powell passed above
everyone else. One of the pupils had been
studying this selection for six months. It
was not only Maud Powell’s greater talent
but also her general knowledge of music that
made it possible for her to grasp new work
readily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lonely father at home was cheered by
messages of his young daughter’s success
and popularity in London, where she was
playing in drawing-rooms and at concerts.
Joachim, a distinguished German violinist,
was so impressed by Maud Powell’s playing
that he wanted her to join his class in Berlin.
He said that she was more than a mere
talented child; that she would, with training,
make a great artist. She passed the examinations
for his class, without the usual six
months’ preparation, and worked hard with
him for a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the longed-for return to America
and the reuniting of the family. Maud
Powell was eager to show her father that his
sacrifices had not been in vain. Many people
thought that the violin was an instrument
for a man only. Nevertheless, at the age of
seventeen, this young girl made her debut
as a violin soloist at a concert of the New
York Philharmonic Society, conducted by
Theodore Thomas. From that time on the
fame of Maud Powell’s violin grew. It was
heard throughout the United States and in
many foreign lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Powell did not play merely for a
livelihood or for fame. Music had meant so
much to her that she felt that she must bring
it into the lives of others. She was especially
eager to give the inspiration of her music to
people who had few opportunities of hearing
great artists. That was why she gave
recitals in hundreds of small towns, and was
always glad to play for schools and colleges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Powell never slighted her programs
even though she was playing in the smallest
place. She gave her best, thinking that some
one in her audience might not have another
opportunity to hear good music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, Miss Powell never gave anything
but her best at any concert. She would
memorize a long selection perfectly even if
she knew it were to be played only once. She
took great pains to have her programs
varied, and delighted in introducing American
compositions to her audiences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1904 Miss Powell married H. Godfrey
Turner. He assisted her greatly by attending
to the business arrangements for her
concerts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great praise and appreciation came to
Maud Powell for the marvelous music that
she brought forth from her violin. However,
the road from gifted childhood to finished
artist was a long, hard one. She pushed
aside every obstacle by her tireless work.
The long hours of practicing and the years
of homelessness and loneliness were endured
for the sake of her beloved music. Maud
Powell will always be remembered, not only
because she played the violin remarkably,
but because she carried the message of music
to out-of-the-way parts of the world.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Ellen H. Richards—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>A Scientist Who Helped Home-Makers</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A half pound of saleratus, please,” demanded a
customer. “I never can cook with soda.” “Give
me baking soda,” another woman insisted. “I
cannot use saleratus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright-eyed young girl behind the
counter of the country store supplied them
both from the same package, rather amused
that they should not know that baking soda
and saleratus are as alike as two peas in a
pod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to know more about the nature
of the things that I am selling,” thought
Ellen Swallow. Little did she dream that
her future years were to be spent in making
life easier and happier for women by enabling
them to learn about these very things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On December 3, 1842, Ellen Henrietta
Swallow was born near the village of Dunstable,
Massachusetts. She was an out-of-door
girl and loved to follow her father and
uncles about the farm. She drove the cows
to pasture, rode horseback, and often pitched
hay. She made a little flower garden too,
and tended it carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Ellen was also quick and skillful at
indoor tasks. Her mother, who had a deft
hand at any kind of housework, taught her
to sew and cook. Ellen’s doll’s bed had
sheets and pillowcases daintily hemstitched
by her own hand. At the country fair, one
year, two prizes fell to thirteen-year-old
Ellen Swallow, one for a beautifully embroidered
handkerchief and another for the
best loaf of bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen’s mother and father were well educated,
and had been teachers. They taught
Ellen at home until she was ready for the
academy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swallow gave up farming and opened
a country store in the village of Westford,
Massachusetts, so that Ellen could attend the
academy there. Ellen enjoyed her studies
and mastered them thoroughly. She was
such a fine Latin student that later she was
able to earn money for her college expenses
by teaching that subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen Swallow was as active and energetic
out of school as in school. She was a capable
little business woman. She waited on customers
in her father’s store and kept his accounts.
She even made trips to Boston to
buy goods for the store. This early training
was very helpful when in later years she had
to handle large sums of money for many philanthropic
and educational purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At home Ellen was often the housekeeper
for weeks at a time, during her frail mother’s
illnesses. She not only cooked and washed,
but she cleaned house, papered rooms, and
laid carpets, as well. What she learned of
managing a house in her school-girl days
was a very valuable addition to what science
taught her later about good home-making.
Ellen Swallow was very quick and capable.
In addition to her school, home, and store
duties, she had time for reading and for
working in her precious flower garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her academy days Ellen Swallow’s
hours were filled by teaching a country
school, helping in the store and at home, and
caring for sick friends and neighbors; but
she was not satisfied. She felt a great longing
to learn and to do more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no college in New England at
that time which admitted women. Ellen
Swallow therefore decided to enter Vassar
College, at Poughkeepsie, New York, which
had only recently been founded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>College days were very happy ones for
this active-minded young woman. She wrote
home to her mother glowing accounts of her
new life and told her all about her school
work and the books that she was reading.
Science was her favorite study. One of her
teachers was Maria Mitchell, who took a
great interest in the young girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After graduating from Vassar College,
Ellen Swallow was eager to go on with the
study of chemistry that she had begun there.
After some difficulty she gained admittance
to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
as its first woman student. In fact, she
was the first woman to enter any strictly
scientific school in the United States. One
of the teachers thought that this young
woman looked rather frail to be taking such
difficult work. The President answered,
“Did you notice her eyes? They are steadfast
and they are courageous. She will not
fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only did she <span class='it'>not</span> fail in her studies, but
she also supported herself. She did tutoring,
took charge of an office for a friend, and
temporarily ran the boarding house where
she lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was feared about this time that the
water near many towns and cities in Massachusetts
was becoming unfit for drinking.
The newly organized State Board of Health
decided to have samples of the water examined
to see whether it contained impurities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Swallow had proved herself to be so
accurate and dependable that the chemist
chosen to analyze the water handed over
most of the work to her. Often she had to
work far into the night when many samples
came in at a time. She analyzed forty thousand
samples of water. This careful work
meant the prevention of much disease. For
ten years she was assistant chemist for the
State Board of Health, and then chemist for
ten years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ellen Swallow was married to Professor
Robert Hallowell Richards, head of
the department of mining engineering in
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
she did not give up her public work. Yet she
maintained a real home in which she carried
out her ideas about building and furnishing,
cleanliness and fresh air, and labor-saving
devices. Many guests were welcomed to this
busy woman’s home and all found it a place
of restfulness and peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Richards’ great desire was that girls
should have the same opportunity to receive
a scientific training as had boys. Largely
through her efforts a Woman’s Laboratory
was opened in connection with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. This Laboratory
was established for the purpose of
giving scientific training to women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Richards gave generously to the Laboratory,
teaching without salary, and contributing
to its support as well. Soon after
women were admitted to the Institute on the
same footing as men, Mrs. Richards was
made Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in
the Institute, a position which she held for
the rest of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Richards might have spent her time
in scientific research. However, she preferred
instead to put her knowledge of
science to practical use. She tested wall
papers and fabrics to see if they contained arsenic,
and staple groceries to detect impurities.
She studied oils to discover how the
danger from explosives could be lessened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Richards wrote many helpful books
about home-making. She organized a society
of people interested in promoting right living
in the home, the school, and the community.
The name of this organization is
American Home Economics Association. Because
of her influence home economics is
now taught in schools throughout the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Ellen H. Richards, sanitary chemist,
the facts of science were never just facts, but
the means of making people healthier and
happier.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Elizabeth Cady Stanton—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Helped to Draft Woman’s Declaration of Independence</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity it is she’s a girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four-year-old Elizabeth heard
this remark over and over again
from the visitors who had come to see her
baby sister. She thought that she ought to
feel sorry for the baby, too. When she was
a little older, Elizabeth Cady realized what a
pity it was that girls and women could not
have the same privileges and advantages as
had boys and men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth Cady was born at Johnstown,
New York, November 12, 1815. When this
little girl grew up, she called the first Woman’s
Rights Convention and worked all her
life to gain more privileges for women. As
a child she felt the disadvantages of being a
girl in the early days of the 1800’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her only brother, a fine promising
college graduate, died, eleven-year-old Elizabeth
realized that her father loved his son
far more than all of his five daughters.
Longing to comfort him Elizabeth climbed
on his knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my daughter, would that you were a
boy!” was all that he could say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that moment Elizabeth resolved
to equal boys. To be learned and courageous
she decided was the way to accomplish
her purpose. Before breakfast the next
morning she went to her dear friend and pastor
and asked him to teach her Greek. She
insisted on beginning that very minute. To
prove herself courageous she learned to
drive a horse, and to leap a fence and ditch
on horseback.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a short time she began to study
Greek, Latin, and mathematics with a class
of boys at the village academy. She did so
well that she won the second prize, a Greek
testament. Joyfully Elizabeth rushed home
expecting to hear her father say, “Now, you
are equal to a boy.” However, his kisses and
praise failed to take away the sting of his
remark, “Ah, you should have been a boy!”
Elizabeth’s father was a distinguished
lawyer and judge. His office adjoined the
house, and there his little daughter spent
much of her time talking with his students
and listening to his clients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often his clients were widows who wept
and complained that the property which they
had brought into the family had been willed
to their sons. Elizabeth could not understand
why her father, who was wise and
kind, could not help these poor women. Then
Judge Cady would take down from the
shelves a big volume and show her the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The students, seeing how interested she
was in the laws about women, amused themselves
by reading to her the most unfair
laws that they could find. They often teased
her, too, in order to hear her bright remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Elizabeth was so distressed by the
unfairness of the law in regard to women
that she made up her mind to cut them all out
of her father’s law books. She refrained
from doing this upon learning that it would
not help the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much to her disgust Elizabeth Cady could
not go to college, as did her boy classmates,
for at that time girls were not admitted.
However, she entered the Willard Seminary
for girls in Troy, New York, where she studied
for some time. Later she went on with
her studies at home, never losing her interest
in laws for women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her twenty-fifth year Elizabeth Cady
married Henry B. Stanton, a lecturer on
antislavery, who later became a lawyer.
After several happy years in Johnstown and
Boston, the young couple settled in Seneca
Falls, New York. By this time the champion
of woman’s rights began to know by
experience something of a woman’s home problems.
She had a big house to manage with
very little help, and her lively girls and boys
needed constant care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her round of everyday duties, however,
Mrs. Stanton did not forget the wrongs to
women. She, together with Lucretia Mott
and some others, called a big meeting, the
first Woman’s Rights Convention, at Seneca
Falls in 1848, to talk over this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this meeting Mrs. Stanton and her coworkers
presented a Declaration of Sentiments
based upon the Declaration of Independence.
They also presented eleven resolutions,
one of which demanded the vote for
women. Mrs. Stanton was entirely responsible
for this resolution and placed great emphasis
upon it. She believed that through
the ballot for women all other rights for
women could be secured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newspapers made a great deal of fun
of all the reforms discussed at the convention,
particularly the proposal that women
should vote. In those days most people were
quite ready to admit that a woman could
manage her home capably and be bright and
entertaining in company. However, they
thought it very unwomanly that she should
dream of helping to make laws to secure
better schools or cleaner streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stanton was surprised and distressed
to have her very serious purpose treated so
lightly, but ridicule did not prevent her from
upholding woman’s rights whenever she had
an opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three years after this she met Susan B.
Anthony, the woman who was to be her lifelong
friend and fellow-worker. Except for
their lectures in the cause of temperance and
antislavery, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony
gave their whole lives to gaining more freedom
for their fellow-women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two friends were very different in
characteristics, but they were of one mind
on the question of woman’s rights. Miss Anthony
had not at first thought it necessary for
women to have the vote, but she was soon
won over to her friend’s opinion. Year after
year these two earnest workers endeavored
to arouse the country to do something for
women. Never a jealous thought as to
which one should have the glory for anything
accomplished marred this fifty years
of friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony lectured
in big cities and all sorts of little out-of-the
way places. Together with their friend Mrs.
Gage, they wrote a very complete history of
what had been done to gain the vote for
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Mrs. Stanton’s children, a daughter,
Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch, has followed
directly in her mother’s footsteps as a public
speaker for the cause of women. She has
also written several books about woman’s
place in the work of the world. Theodore
Stanton, one of the sons, also writes in behalf
of women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout a long lifetime Elizabeth Cady
Stanton courageously and steadfastly pleaded
the cause of women. She lived to see them
enjoying better property rights and educational
privileges, and in four states helping
to make the laws. Eighteen years after her
death the Nineteenth Amendment gave the
vote to women throughout the United States.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Harriet Beecher Stowe—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Whose Story of Slavery Aroused the Whole World</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the night of the annual exhibition
of the Litchfield Academy. Twelve-year-old
Harriet Beecher waited eagerly for a
certain part of the program. Presently she
heard read before all the learned people assembled
the familiar words of her own composition,
one of the three chosen for this
great occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Harriet listened to the sentences that
she had composed with so much care, she
watched the face of her father who sat on
the platform. It brightened. She knew that
he was interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the entertainment she
heard him ask, “Who wrote that composition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her teacher replied, “Your daughter, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the proudest moment of Harriet’s
life. When this little academy student became
a woman she wrote a book which set
the whole world to thinking of the evil of
slavery. It was <span class='it'>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Beecher was born at Litchfield,
Connecticut, June 14, 1811. Her father had
only a country parson’s meagre salary to
provide for the wants of eleven children.
What a father he was—grave and serious
enough in the pulpit, but full of fun and enthusiasm
at home. It was mere play for
Harriet and the boys to pile wood, when their
father superintended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was very rich in sisters and brothers.
She loved them all dearly, especially the
merry, energetic big sister, Catherine, and
the chubby little boy two years younger than
she, Henry Ward Beecher, who grew up to
be a famous minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Harriet had only a sweet memory
of her mother who had died when she was a
small child. Wherever she went, she was
told of her mother’s beautiful life. It made
her very happy to know that she had a mother
whom everyone loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no expensive toys in the Beecher
family, but Harriet was well content without
them. She played with her glass-eyed
wooden doll and a set of cups and saucers
made by her own hands out of codfish bones.
In the woodpile she found treasures in the
moss and lichens on the logs. From them she
fashioned little pictures using the moss for
green fields, sprigs of spruce for the trees,
and bits of glass for lakes and rivers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of Harriet’s happiest hours were
spent curled up in a corner of her father’s
study, surrounded by her favorite books.
It was a peaceful, restful place, she thought.
She liked to glance up at her dear father as
he was writing or thinking over his sermons.
She enjoyed looking at the friendly faces of
the books on the shelves. Very few of them,
however, were books that she could understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day while rummaging in a barrel of
old sermons in the attic, Harriet came upon
a copy of the <span class='it'>Arabian Nights</span>. How she and
her brothers pored over its pages! Another
precious treasure discovered in a barrel was
Shakespeare’s play, <span class='it'>The Tempest</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet’s delight in stories was satisfied
in another way. Every fall it was the custom
to make enough apple sauce to last for
the winter. It took a whole barrelful for the
big Beecher family. All the little fingers
were pressed into service to peel or quarter
apples. Mr. Beecher would then ask who
could tell the best story. As the apples bubbled
and hissed in the big brass kettle, story
after story went around. Mr. Beecher, himself,
recited scenes from Sir Walter Scott’s
novels, which were then new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the unheated, barnlike meetinghouse
where Mr. Beecher preached, Harriet also
spent many happy hours, although she was
cold and cramped from sitting through the
long sermons. Usually she did not understand
her father’s big words, but one day he
spoke so earnestly and simply about God’s
love that Harriet never forgot it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Harriet grew up, she married Calvin
Ellis Stowe. He was a professor in the
Lane Theological Seminary, in Cincinnati,
Ohio, of which her father had become the
president.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Ohio, adjacent to the slave state of Kentucky,
everybody was thinking and talking
about slavery. The Fugitive Slave Law,
whereby runaway slaves must be returned
to their masters, was causing heated discussions.
Mrs. Stowe and her husband believed
this to be a very unjust law and they helped
a colored girl, the “Eliza” of <span class='it'>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</span>, to escape from her pursuers. Mrs.
Stowe opened a school for colored children
in her house, and raised money to buy the
freedom of a slave boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since the days of her school compositions
Mrs. Stowe had enjoyed writing, and
some of her stories had found their way into
the papers. When Professor Stowe went to
Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine, to
teach, his wife tried to do a little writing
to add to his small salary. However, the
work of looking after a large house and her
family of small children left her little time
for writing stories. Sometimes with her paper
on the corner of the kitchen table and her
ink on the teakettle, she managed to write a
story, superintend the making of pastry, and
watch the baby at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Mrs. Stowe received a letter from
a relative urging her to write something that
would stir the country against the evil of
slavery. She earnestly declared that she
would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon thereafter the plot for her story,
<span class='it'>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span>, flashed across her mind.
She wrote a chapter as quickly as possible
and sent it to the <span class='it'>National Era</span>, an antislavery
paper. Chapter after chapter followed,
written rapidly as the scenes of the story
presented themselves to her. When it was
completed it was published as a book. In a
few days ten thousand copies were sold; in a
year, three hundred thousand copies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stowe wrote many other books,
though none of them attained the prominence
of <span class='it'>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span>. This book is considered
to have been one of the most influential
and widely read novels in literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From distinguished people all over the
world came letters of congratulation to Mrs.
Stowe. What she had written just because
she felt that she must, with no thought of
money or fame, brought her both. Harriet
Beecher Stowe was further honored by being
elected to the Hall of Fame in 1910.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Beecher Stowe’s gift of expression,
which she had been cultivating for
many years under all sorts of difficulties,
made it possible for her to draw a picture of
slavery that aroused the whole world.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Kate Douglas Wiggin—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Who Put the Joy of Living Into Her Books</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although Katie Smith loved all the
books on the black walnut bookshelves,
the ones that she took down most often
were some fat volumes by Charles Dickens.
So much did she enjoy these stories that she
named her yellow dog “Pip” after a character
in one of them; and across her sled in
big scarlet letters were painted the words
“The Artful Dodger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Katie’s mother read in the paper
that Mr. Charles Dickens had come to America.
When Katie heard that he was going
to give a reading from his books in Portland,
Maine, only sixteen miles away, she was very
much excited. How she longed to see and
hear the wonderful man who had created so
many delightful characters!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katie and her mother had planned to go to
Charlestown, Massachusetts, for a visit, stopping
overnight in Portland. Now Katie’s
mother decided that they would leave home
so as to be in Portland on the night of the
reading. But alas! a grown-up cousin, instead
of little Katie, was taken to hear Mr.
Dickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katie bore her disappointment as best she
could, and the next day after the reading she
received her reward. Who should be riding
on the very same train with Katie and her
mother, but the great Charles Dickens himself!
While Katie’s mother was talking with
an acquaintance, the little girl slipped into
the empty seat beside her favorite author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you come from?” inquired
Mr. Dickens in a surprised tone of voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came from Hollis, Maine,” stammered
Katie Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the little girl and the famous author
were chatting away like old friends.
Mr. Dickens chuckled when he heard about
the naming of Katie’s dog and her sled, and
his eyes grew moist when she spoke of the
characters that made her cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This nine-year-old admirer of Dickens had
not the slightest idea that one day she would
be an author herself. Years later, however,
when she was known as Kate Douglas Wiggin,
she wrote a delightful story about another
little State-of-Maine girl, entitled
<span class='it'>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</span>. She also
wrote many other enjoyable books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate Douglas Smith was not a State-of-Maine
girl by birth. She was born in Philadelphia,
September 28, 1859. When she was
six years old her family moved to the village
of Hollis, Maine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Katie Smith loved the world in
which she lived and especially her own little
corner of it on the banks of the Saco River.
What fun she had with her little sister Nora
and her playmate Annie. Nora is better
known to us as Nora Archibald Smith, the
author of many charming stories for children.
These little girls gathered velvety
pussy willows, hunted for arbutus in the
early spring, and picked wild strawberries
and raspberries in the summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How amusing Katie found the froggery, a
nice quiet pool where lived her favorite
frogs! She knew them all by name and twice
a week she arranged them very gently in a
row on a strip of board for a singing lesson.
In the winter she enjoyed coasting and snowballing.
She also liked to be in the house
where she could play with her orphanage of
paper dolls and read her beloved books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To little Katie Smith, work was almost as
amusing as play. It was fun, she thought,
to cut up rhubarb for sauce, to make milk
toast for supper, to water the plants, to iron
the handkerchiefs, and to go for the milk.
Just to be alive, to run along the river bank,
to help about the house, was enough for this
joyous child. No dreams of authorship had
come to her, though she was filling her mind
with the pictures which she was later to give
to the world in her books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katie Smith was taught at home and also
attended a district school. Later she went
to a boarding school in Maine, after which
she attended Abbot Academy in Andover,
Massachusetts, from which she was graduated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Kate Smith was seventeen years old
she followed her family to Santa Barbara,
California, where they had gone several
years before. As there was very little money
in the family treasury, the elder daughter of
the house felt that she must begin to help at
once. A girl’s story which she had written
merely to amuse herself she decided to send
to a magazine editor. What was Kate’s delight
to receive in payment for the story a
check for one hundred and fifty dollars,
which came just in time to pay some taxes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proud young author, however, did not
think of writing for a living. She decided
that she did not yet know enough to write.
She realized that she must live a little longer
and learn more. In the meantime she decided
to find some useful work to do. Years later,
after she had become a successful author,
she said that this decision was the most sensible
act of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate Smith soon found the work that she
sought. Kindergartens were still very new
in America. Miss Smith studied the system
and organized a free kindergarten in San
Francisco, the first one to be established
west of the Rockies. This young woman was
very successful in bringing happiness into
the lives of the little children who flocked to
her kindergarten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was for the purpose of raising money
for kindergartens that the young teacher
wrote two stories, <span class='it'>The Story of Patsy</span>, and
<span class='it'>The Birds’ Christmas Carol</span>. She had them
printed and sold at twenty-five cents a copy.
Miss Smith thought that the only reason they
sold well was because so many friends were
anxious to help the good cause of free kindergartens.
Little did she realize that these
books would later bring her fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1880 Kate Douglas Smith married Samuel
Bradley Wiggin, who was a California
lawyer. It was not until several years later
that Mrs. Wiggin thought of sending a paper-covered
copy of <span class='it'>The Birds’ Christmas Carol</span> to
a publisher. This charming story of
the Ruggles family was accepted at once and
more stories requested. From that time on
Mrs. Wiggin devoted herself to writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Girls and boys of to-day all over the world
love her Rebecca, Carol, Patsy, and Timothy
just as the little girl of Hollis, Maine, loved
the children in Dickens’ stories. Kate Douglas
Wiggin wrote often for children because
she loved them and never forgot what it is
like to be a child. She has also written many
very entertaining books for older people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rebecca” is not, as some people have
thought, small Katie Smith herself. However,
the district school where Rebecca wrote
her famous composition was the one that the
author attended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Kate Douglas Wiggin’s books are many
pictures of the life that she lived as a child.
She put herself into her books, but not as a
character. In her stories you will find something
of her own quick wit, her cheerfulness,
her satisfaction in doing and helping, and
her joy of living.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Frances E. Willard—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The Girl Who Fought The Dragon, Drink</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances called her brother Oliver’s
attention to the new law that she had
written the previous night for “Fort
City.” It read: “We will have no saloons or
billiard halls, and then we will not need any
jails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little girl’s favorite game was to plan
a play city, a place where everyone could live
happily. She took a special delight in making
laws for the health and pleasure of the
citizens of her city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Planning the city was only play, but in this
game as well as in all others Frances Willard
showed her remarkable ability as an organizer.
Little did she realize that years later
this ability would make her a valuable leader
of the Temperance Cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances Elizabeth Willard was born at
Churchville, New York, September 28, 1839.
When she was but a tiny child, her parents
moved to Oberlin, Ohio, in order that they
might study at the university. After a few
years of happy student life, Mr. Willard was
obliged to give up his books and his dream of
becoming a minister for a life outdoors in the
West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What an adventure the journey was for
the three little Willards! There were no fine
Pullman trains in which they could travel,
for there were no railroads in that section
of the country in those days. Three clumsy
prairie schooners carried them to their new
home. Frances and her little sister Mary
rode in the third, perched comfortably
enough among the cushions on the top of
their father’s old-fashioned desk. For three
weeks they traveled over the prairies, stopping
only to cook their meals, gypsy-fashion,
and to rest on Sundays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forest Home” was the name given to the
pretty rustic cottage that Mr. Willard built
among the oaks and hickory groves, by the
banks of the Rock River, near Janesville,
Wisconsin. It was a delightful place in which
to spend a happy childhood. To be sure, the
Willards’ only callers at first were the chipmunks
and birds, but there were no dull days.
Every minute was filled. Frances did her
share of the household tasks and far more
than her share in planning the family games.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the lively Frances was the leader
in all the fun, there was one sport in which
she was not allowed to join. This was horseback
riding. Confiding to her brother that
she <span class='it'>must</span> ride something, she tried the cow.
Her father laughed when he saw her on her
clumsy steed, and allowed her to have a horse
after that. This simple way of disposing of
difficulties served her well all her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Active and full of fun as Frances Willard
was, she liked to be quiet and thoughtful too.
A black oak in the garden bore the sign:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:0.7em;margin-bottom:0.7em;'>The Eagle’s Nest—Beware!</p>

<p class='pindent'>High up in the leafy branches Frances would
sit for hours, making up bits of verse or editing
the “Fort City” newspaper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sunday afternoons the children would
wander with their mother in the orchard
while she talked to them about the beauty
that God had created. They realized that
God was very near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances was quite young when she first
heard from her parents of the unhappiness
that drink brings. With the other children
she signed a pledge written in the big family
Bible, and ending:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“So here we pledge perpetual hate</p>
<p class='line0'>To all that can intoxicate.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>For some years Mrs. Willard took charge
of the children’s lessons, but later a young
woman from the East came to teach them
and some of their little neighbors. No child
was ever more hungry for knowledge than
little Frances Willard. She often declared
that she wanted to learn everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a day when Frances was very
happy and excited. A little schoolhouse had
been built in the woods about a mile away.
It was so small and brown and plain that she
called it “a sort of big ground-nut,” but it
was a real schoolhouse, with a Yale graduate
for a teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on Frances and Mary went away to
college. They attended Milwaukee Female
College, and then Northwestern Female College
at Evanston, Illinois, from which they
were graduated. At these two schools energetic,
high-spirited Frances was a leader,
both in and out of the classroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances Willard was the same earnest,
hungry-minded, determined girl when she
became a teacher that she had been as a
student. She began to teach in her own
“brown-nut” schoolhouse during her first
college vacation. After her graduation
from college she spent a number of years
in the teaching profession. During this time
she was at the head of several important
schools. She concluded her teaching career
as Dean of the Woman’s College in Northwestern
University.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time many people were becoming
alarmed at the amount of drunkenness
throughout the United States. They were
distressed by the misery caused by drink. In
the small towns in the Middle West, women
often marched through the streets singing,
praying, and begging saloon keepers to give
up their business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Chicago a band of women, marching to
the City Council to ask to have the Sunday
closing law enforced, were rudely treated by
the mob. Frances Willard had never forgotten
the pledge that she had signed in the
family Bible. The insults to these women
aroused her fighting spirit. She felt that she
must help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the mail brought her two letters.
One letter offered her the principalship of a
prominent school in New York City, which
would pay her a large salary. The other letter
asked her to become president of the Chicago
branch of the Woman’s Christian Temperance
Union. Because of the meager
funds of this organization no salary was offered
her. Although she had no means besides
her earnings, Miss Willard chose the
latter position. Later, discovering that she
had no private income, this organization provided
a sufficient salary for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frances Willard felt sure that she should
devote her life to the cause of Temperance.
The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union
needed a leader badly, so with all the energy
with which she had planned her play city,
Miss Willard developed this organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that time on, Frances Willard gave
her whole life to the Cause. She pleaded eloquently
for Temperance in every large city
in the United States and in many small ones.
She became the president of the National
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, and
later of the World’s Woman’s Christian
Temperance Union, which was organized
through her efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the National Capitol there is a hall
where each state may place the statue of two
of its most beloved leaders. Illinois erected
there the first statue to a woman—a marble
figure of Frances E. Willard. In the year
1910 Frances E. Willard’s name was selected
for the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day, we have that for which Miss Willard
dreamed and worked: a nation in which
the sale of intoxicating drinks is prohibited
by law. The passing of this milestone on the
road to Temperance has greatly benefited
the world. To Frances E. Willard, who contributed
so much to the success of this movement,
humanity is indebted.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>Ella Flagg Young—</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Whose Slogan Was “Better Schools for Girls and Boys”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that mean, Ella?” The
boy lifted his eyes from his weeding
as he put the question to his
sister. Ella, seated on a chair between the
garden rows, rested her open book on her
knees a moment and sat thinking. Then,
choosing her words carefully, she explained
what she had just read aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see now,” the boy exclaimed. “Go
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ella resumed the reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ella Flagg was in poor health as a little
girl, so her mother chose gardening as the
best means of keeping her outdoors. Ella
found that while her fingers were busy pulling
weeds, down one long row and up another,
her active little mind was eager to be
busy too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and her brother decided to combine
reading and gardening. The plan worked
well for these two children, as it relieved
the weeding hours of monotony. Ella then
made the discovery that whatever she tried
to explain she must first understand very
clearly herself. It was in this way that Ella
Flagg Young, who became a famous educator,
did her first teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first thirteen years of her life Ella
Flagg lived in Buffalo, New York, where she
was born January 15, 1845. On account of
ill health she was not allowed to go to school
with her sister and brother. Her mother
and father believed that there would be
plenty of time for regular lessons when her
body had grown stronger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was eight or nine years of age before
she learned to read and then she taught herself.
One morning Ella’s mother was reading
in a newspaper an account of a fire. Ella
was so much interested that she took the paper
and tried to read the article. She remembered
the exact beginning, but she did
not know any of the other words. With
some help, however, she was finally able to
read the entire article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even though this little girl did not have
regular lessons, there was much to be learned
in a home such as hers. Mrs. Flagg was an
energetic, capable woman. She was skillful
in managing household affairs and much in
demand among her friends and neighbors,
when there was sickness or trouble in their
homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From her mother, Ella learned how to settle
household problems for herself. Because
of this training she was able always to look
squarely in the face the big problems that
confronted her, when she was at the head of
the Chicago school system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Ella could learn a great deal, too,
merely from hearing her mother and father
talk, for they were thoughtful, intelligent
people. Mr. Flagg had had to leave school
when he was only ten years old to be apprenticed
to the sheet-metal trade. However, by
reading and study he had educated himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes Ella used to go to her father’s
shop and sit for hours watching him at work
at his forge. She asked questions about all
the processes that he followed so that she
really understood what he was doing. From
these pleasant hours in the shop came her
love of handwork and her interest in having
it taught in the public schools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ella began to go to school her father
took a great interest in the way in which
she studied. He had always done his own
thinking and he did not want his daughter to
depend on other people for hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Ella discussed with her father a
drawing in her textbook of an hydraulic
press that she was studying. She realized
that he was displeased with what she said so
she immediately decided to study the drawing
more thoroughly. Soon she discovered
that an important part had been left out. In
the examination on the press the next day
the papers of all the other students, who had
blindly followed the book, were marked zero,
while Ella’s received a perfect mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ella Flagg graduated from a Chicago high
school and also from the Chicago Normal
School. This ambitious girl began to teach
when she was seventeen years of age. She
first taught in a primary grade for six weeks
and then in a higher grade where some of
the pupils were larger and older than she.
In a year she was made head assistant of the
school and in two years principal of the practice
school, where she helped to train the
normal-school students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ella Flagg married William Young in 1868.
However, she did not give up her work. She
climbed steadily up the ladder of the teaching
profession. Even though she had become
very successful she felt that she needed
more education. Consequently she studied
at the University of Chicago from which she
received the degree of Ph. D.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Young became assistant superintendent
of the Chicago schools, then professor of
education in the University of Chicago.
Later she was made principal of the Chicago
Normal School, and finally superintendent
of schools in Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Mrs. Young became superintendent
of the Chicago schools she began to
work for the children. She ordered the windows
to be opened, top and bottom, in the
schoolrooms to do away with the foul air
produced by a poor system of ventilation.
She organized fresh-air classes for pupils
who needed an extra amount of oxygen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked the teachers to help her improve
the course of study. Handwork, in which
the hours at her father’s shop had given her
an interest, she introduced into every grade.
A new study, which she called “Chicago”
brought the children into closer relation with
their own city, teaching them its geography,
history, and government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fame of Mrs. Young’s work in education
spread beyond her own city. The National
Education Association, which had
never had a woman in office, made her its
president. Mrs. Young wrote many books
about education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Young was asked how she
managed to accomplish so much, she always
said that it was through systematic work.
The first year that she began to teach, she
planned to devote three evenings a week to
study, three to seeing her friends, and Sunday
evening to church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long lifetime Ella Flagg Young
worked to solve the problem of educating the
girls and boys of Chicago and the nation.
The clear and independent thinking that she
had cultivated as a girl helped to give her a
place as one of the great educators of our
day.</p>
